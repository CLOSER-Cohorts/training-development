## Using metadata to discover and understand data

In this unit, we will explore how we can use metadata as an effective tool to discover and understand research projects. 

First, lets look at discovery.

We may need to find research projects and data for a variety of reasons. This includes ...
- To conduct a literature review
- To help inform the design process of a new research project and understand how that project will fit into existing research
- To find secondary data for a new research project
- To help produce materials such as policy briefings

How do we discover data?

If you had to find a research study that corresponds with the information below, how would you go about it?

_[Activity: give information about research and ask people to spend time trying to find the research page. Don't specify where to look or how to go about it. Reflect on what they did to try and find this dataset e.g. go online, use a data catalogue or (meta)data repository. Answer to provided on next slide]

>[!NOTE]
> Need to choose which research study / dataset to use for this activity. I think maybe one for UK data service.

## Tools to discover research

One common way people discover research is through data repositories and catalogues. Data repositories and catalogues are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are different tools.

**Data repository** <p></p>
The UK Data Service describes a data repository as 'a centralised database system that collects, manages, and stores datasets for later use'. They are designed for the long-term storage of datasets which can then be managed and accessed through the repository. 

**Data catalogue** <p></p>
CoData defines a data catalogue as a 'curated collection of metadata records describing datasets and their data elements. Curated and organised using a formal metadata schema appropriate to data and data sets (e.g. ReCollect etc).'. Sometimes a data catalogue is referred to as a metadata repository (note that this is different from a data repository which stores the actual data). <p></p>

The main difference between the two tools is that a data repository stores the actual data, whereas a data catalogue stores the metadata records only. Commonly, data repositories and data catalogues will specify what metadata they require. They will specify this through issuing a schema or a standard that researchers should follow. We will follow schemas and standards in unit 2.6.

So thinking back to the question, how do we use a data repository or cataglogue to find a research project that matches the information?
How do you think metadata is used to help us **discover** research in catalogues and repositories?
[Explain how to find a dataset as listed above by going to relevant catalogue/repository site, use the search/filter functions, use the dataset page to understand whether it's a match.]_

>[!NOTE]
> KR Are data catalogues used interchangeable as metadata repositories? Should we also include data registry here?
> It would be good to include a venn diagram here of the different tools so we can show their overlapping uses and separate functionalities.

## Using metadata to discover resources

As metadata is machine-actionable, it provides more functionality than unstructured documentation. Metadata can be leveraged as a discovery tool in data repositories and catalogues through the search and filter functions. 

Metadata enables people to find resources based on keywords. 

Metadata terms can also be leveraged as filters to explore a large set of objects or data. 
These filters could manage high level metadata, for example:


Or they could filter low level metadata, for example:


Outside of research, we use metadata as a discovery tool all the time. For example on shopping sites, the filters we use to find the product we're after are metadata that have been used to described the product.

## Finding a data repository or catalogue for your research

Data catalogues and data repositories can be cross-discpline or discipline specific. So, how can you find the right data catalogue and data repository for your area of interest? 

_[Point to resources where people can search and find data catalogue and repositories - re3data, FAIRSharing]_

Now, using the resource above, find data catalogues and/or repositories that are relevant to your area of interest or research.

>[!NOTE]
> Is it important to define between the two? If so, is the above differentiation correct? <p></p>
> KR question: are metadata repositories a distinct thing from data repositories? If so, what is that distinction? I will add metadata repositories as a separate tool into this unit if it is. <p></p>
> We could show the same study shown in the UK Data Service and CLOSER to show the differences in the information they provide? <p></p>
> Maybe we should also specify the difference between data repositories and metadata repositories? <p></p>
> Need resources where you can search catalogues and repositories - FAIRSharing

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Need a sentence at the start of this to link to the discover and understand research point above, and the discvoering data activity.

## Discovery to understanding 

Once we have used the search and filter functions on a data repository or data catalogue to find a research project, how can we use metadata to further _understand_ what a research project is about?

When we  click through to a particular research project on a data repository or catalogue, we are taken to their profile page. This page presents us with more information about that project. For example:

_[Provide a screenshot of a research profile on a catalogue/repository. Also provide a link to this page.]_


Looking at the page above, what sort of information does the metadata tell us about the project?

Now take some time to look at the whole repository and catalogue. Click into the profiles of different research projects. 
What can you observe about the documentation/information around different research projects? Is it similar or different? Does it use the same structure?

---

## Metadata as structured documentation 

Data catalogues and repositories will often ask research projects wishing to list or deposit their data to submit a certain level of metadata. The repository or catalogue will specify what the minimum metadata requirements are so the same level of information is provided for all resources. Through standardising the level of metadata across the resources, people using the repository or catalogue to find relevant research will get an even experience and be able to search efficiently. Having this standardised level of information also helps us to build trust in the data catalogue or repository as well as trust the research projects that are stored on the site. 

We will also look at other tools that are used to standardise metadata in the upcoming units 2.5 and 2.6.

>[!NOTE]
> Again, now wondering whether this unit should be moved up so we can let people explore the use of metadata before going into CV and metadata standards as best practice so we can refer back to this activity as a practical basis

## Understanding research projects in more detail

As we discussed, research data profiles often give us high-level information around the research project: the who, what, where, when and why.

However, if you were asked to describe what was in the dataset, would you be able to do it?

For example, if you looked at the research project profile below from a data repository, what could you tell someone about the actual data it collected?

[Give link to research project profile page].

Would you be able to describe what variables are within the dataset? Or how many cases it recorded for each variable?

>[!NOTE]
> Need to be concious here of the fact metadata repositories will list variables directly within the repository so you can search and filter them.

---
## Understanding dataset: differences in catalogue and repositories in understanding 

As we looked at in Unit 2.2, metadata can also describe the data within a dataset, also referred to as the low level metadata.

On data repositories, we are able to search metadata about the data, searching and filtering to find specific variables for example.
_[Give example of variable search tools]_

Research projects may also provide additional documentation stored alongside datasets called Codebooks or data dictionaries. These can be stored on data repository and catalogue sites alongside the high level information about the research project.

>[!NOTE]
> KR Q: want to check, on the UK data service, is the data catalogue separate to the [variable and question bank](https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/variables)? So within UK data service website, they have both a data catalogue and a data repository

---

## Understanding research: Codebooks and data dictionaries

Both codebooks and data dictionaries aggregate low level metadata in order to give a robust overview of what data is included in a research project or dataset. If a project didn't have this metadata, it would not be possible to create these types of documentation. Often, codebooks and data dictionaries can be generated automatically from metadata that is already created and managed as part of the resource process.

While they are sometimes used interchangeably however they are different tools.

UK Data Service defines a Codebook as a document that 'describes the contents, structure, and layout of a data collection. Codebooks begin with basic front matter, including the study title, name of the principal investigator(s), table of contents, and an introduction describing the purpose and format of the codebook. Some codebooks also include methodological details, such as how weights were computed, and data collection instruments, while others, especially with larger or more complex data collections, leave those details for a separate user guide and/or data collection instrument.'

CoData defines Data dictionary as a 'collection of descriptions of the data objects or items in a data model. After each data object or item is given a descriptive name, its relationship is described (or it becomes part of some structure that implicitly describes relationship), the type of data (such as text or image or binary value) is described, possible predefined values are listed, and a brief textual description is provided. This collection can be organised for reference into a data dictionary.'

_[ADD A CLEAR LINE ABOUT THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO]_

>[!NOTE]
> Is it necessary to differentiate between Codebook and Data Dictionary in this course? If so, what is the difference we would like to identify? The terms are used interchangeably by many orgs so would be good to get a clear understanding of this as I'm struggling

## Using Codebooks and data dictionaries

_In progress section_

Add information about:
- Where you can find codebooks/data dictionaries and how you can access them
- Give an example of a codebook/data dictionary and ask what information you can gain from them (do this as a tiered activity e.g. link people to the resarch profile page first and ask them whether they can infomration around different variables. Then provide the link to the codebook or data dictionary)
