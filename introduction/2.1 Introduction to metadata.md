## A mystery canned drink ... a metaphor

Imagine it's a hot day and you're very thirsty. You come across a plain, sealed drink can on the side of a road ...

<img src="img/plain-can.png" alt="Alt Text" width="180" height="280">

Do you know what's inside the can? Would you want to drink it?

---

## A mystery canned drink ... a metaphor

Because the can doesn't have a label, we don't know ...
- What's inside 
- Where it's come from
- When it was made
- Who made it

It's unlikely that anyone will want to drink from that can, and if they do, it's a risk!

---

## A mystery canned drink ... explained

Alternatively, if you came across this can in a local supermarket, would you know what is inside it? Would you be happy to drink it?

## A mystery canned drink ... explained

Most people would be more confident about what is inside the can, as the packaging contains:

- The brand (producer)
- Description of the drink and its flavour
- Ingredient list
- Nutritional information
- Location of production
- Producer contact information
- Best before date

With this information, you have a better insight into what's inside the can and whether you can trust its contents and want to drink it.

The can is even more trustworthy if it's found in a shop you know and trust. If the can was stocked in a shop  alongside other similar drinks, you would be able to read the labels, compare the products, and make an informed decision about the drink you pick.

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Suggest removing "If the drink was found on the side of the road, you would probably wouldn't trust it contents and would avoid drinking it. However,", as we've already said the first bit before. So I'd include the first sentence followed by "If the can was stocked...". Love this metaphor and the way it's written, by the way! <br>
>:large_blue_diamond: KR, have updated. Archived text below. Mark as complete? <br>
>  If the drink was found on the side of the road, you would probably wouldn't trust it contents and would avoid drinking it. However,

>[!NOTE]
> JJ+ KR notes: Legally required information, what information is necessary and who is it important to/why <br>
> JJ+ KR notes: Different information for different audiences - sugar, diabeties <br>
> BO - not sure if you plan to include this info, but I actually think it reads fine as is and is a good entry point to metadata.
>:large_blue_diamond: KR, have added section below as to why the information necessary. Can review and decide whether we want to include.

---

## Why do we need this information

It can take companies more time and resources to produce detailed packaging for products so, why do it?

First, companies want people to find and buy their product. If it's not, the company will fail at their goal of making a profit. Having good information about the product makes it more trustworthy and engaging for customers and therefore, people are more likely to buy it.

Second, this may be legally required information, such as ingredients list or place of origin. Without this, companies would not be able to produce and sell their porducts.

---

## How does the can relate to metadata ...

Imagine the liquid inside the can is data from a research project. 

The label that provides information about the drink (the brand, location of production, ingredients list, nutritional information etc.) is the metadata which describes the research project and the data, telling us what it is and how it was produced.

Like the plain can, if a research project doesn't any metadata, we don't know any contextual information about a research project such as _who_ collected the data, _when_ and _where._ If we don't have metadata, we also don't know what data exists within the datasets.

Similar to storing the can in the supermarket and comparing it with other cans, metadata repositories store metadata for different datasets in the same place. This allows us to search and compare across different datasets, assessing what data is most relevant for us, as well as increasing the trustworthiness of the data.

In the same way that having product information helps companies sell their products, metadata helps researchers make their data discoverable and reusable, leading to more citations of their data. Moreover, creating robust metadata could be a funding requirement for the research project.

Let's consider this in a research context ...

>[!NOTE]
> BO - I really like the point above, and I definitely think we should include it somewhere, but I think there'd be a better connection between the start of this section "...without metdata, we don't know what the dataset consists of..." and the next section "...what would you need to know in order to understand and use this data?", if we moved the repo bit somewhere else.

>[!NOTE]
> BO - I think the first two sentences are a bit confusing, as we're swapping between the can and the dataset. Suggest removing, as the next sentence flows nicely from the first anyway.
>:large_blue_diamond: KR, I have tried clarifying the first couple of sentences as I just want to be really clear how the metaphor transfer to a research environment. However, if you feel it reads better without, then we can go with that.

## Understanding a mystery dataset

Imagine you are undertaking a research project into XXX. You will use secondary data and  need to identify relevant datasets for your project.

You come across this dataset and you need to determine whether it would be useful for your research.

What information would you need to know whether this dataset is relevant for you research project?

What information would you need to certify and trust this data and make sure you can include it in your research project?

We wouldn't want to include a real raw dataset in the training unless it's a publicly available training dataset. Is that what this is?

---

## Information you need to understand data

Here are some of the questions you may need to ask in order to understand the dataset and determine whether it should be included in your research research project. 

![](img/data_qu_themedbubbles.png "Alt text here")

How do we get the answer to these questions as someone who is coming across this data for the first time?

> :large_orange_diamond: KR Do we need to include the purple bubbles which is more questionnaire specigic? Or should we omit questionnaire specific questions?

---

## Metadata: answering essential quesitons

To answer these questions, we need metadata. 

Metadata is documentation that describes the research project and its data, and it is normally created by the person(s) who conducted the research. Metadata provides us with the context we need to understand and interpret the research project and its data so we can use in an intelligent and meaningful way.

As a starting point, metadata can be considered as the who/what/where/when/why/how of the data. 
- **Who** collected the data? 
- **What** data did they collect? 
- **When** was the data collected? 
- **Where** was the data collected? 
- **Why** was the data collected? 
- **How** was the data collected?

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Suggest changing the above sentence to something like "To answer these questions, we need metadata.", because if they're wanting to understand someone else's dataset like in the example above, they'd need to find the metadata, not create it, if that makes sense? The next WWWWWH part would still make sense if we changed this sentence. <br>
> :large_blue_diamond: KR Agree, have updated. Mark as complete?

---

## Information about the project

Through answering the questions in the green bubbles, metadata can describe the research project. Metadata about the overall research project may also be called high-level metadata as it gives an overview of the whole research effort (there is more information on the different levels of metadata in unit 2.2).

**What** is the project about?
- Title of the project
- Subject or topic of the project
- Abstract giving context for the project

**Who** created the data?
- Creator of the research project
- Publisher of the research

**When** was the data available?
- Date research started
- Date research completed
- Date made available

**Where** was the data was collected?
- Country
- Region
- City

---

## High-level metadata

Why is this high-level metadata important for us in understanding a research project and determining whether if its relevant for our research activities?

High-level metadata gives us a quick snapshot of what the research project is about. This is particularly useful when we are looking through a large amount of research. We are also provided with key supporting information that may not be included in the dataset itslef, for example who created the data, where it was conducted, how to access the data and who to contact for further infomraiton about the project.

For example, here is high level metadata for the dataset:

_[Add screenshot of a data catalogue page once we have chosen what dataset we are using]_

Now we know the high level information about how the dataset came about, what other information do we need to determine if this dataset can be used in our secondary research?

>[!NOTE]
> **NOTES from JJ/KR convo:**
> Why do you have this information? <br>
> E.g. having information around publisher and creator = trust, governance around data <br>
> Abstract gives rationale for data <br>
> Why do you want this metadata <br>
> Put more abstract rationales for the metadata <br>
> Examples of varying levels of information - which one would you trust more? <br>
> E.g. want to look at Scottish data (only UK specified) etc.

---

## Information about the data

Through answering the blue bubbles, metadata can describe the data itself. This can be referred to as data-level metadata (see unit 2.2 for more information on the different levels of metadata)

What do the column headings mean?
- Variables the dataset contains

What do the numbers mean?
- Numeric values / codes
- Unit of measurement
- Missing data values

What type of data are they?
- Data type: numeric, string

How was the data collected
- Data collection instrument

>[!NOTE]
> KR Once we have the data we want to use, can include examples of the study / dataset metadata for study e.g. a screenshot of the study page / table with the variable names included <br>
> :large_orange_diamond: KR I have left the purple bubbles (questionnaires) - should we remove those questions or we include that here?

---

## Data level metadata

Data level metadata let's us know what the dataset consists of such as the type of data it contains, what the data means and what units of measurement are used. This further helps us determine whether we think a dataset will be useful for our research activity. It is also helpful in helping us interpret a dataset. If we don't have data-level metadata, we might not know that numbers in a certain column actually indicate different categories, or what unit of measurement is used to capture a variable.

If we didn't have data-level metadata and only had high-level metadata, we would have to guess about what the dataset contains or contact someone for further details. We may then access the data, 

Equally, if we only had data level metadata, we wouldn't know important information about who produced the data, when it was produced and where. 

---

## Challenges of not having this metadata

If you didn't have this metadata, how would you go about finding the information you need to understand the data?

We would porbably have to engage with time-consuming processes, such as contacting people or organisations to get further information about the dataset and what it contains. 

While some information about data exists in research papers and outputs, it may take time to find and extract the information you need, or the information may be incomplete or unsuitable to facilitate reuse. Also, the purpose of a research paper is to report the findings of a particular research question, but data can be used to answer more research questions than the one it was originally intended to measure.

Metadata allows us to maximise the potential and impact of data. It provides the information needed for people to efficiently discover, understand and (re)use data, whether that's for secondary research or a literature review. With metadata, data can reach more people and enables people to use the same dataset for different purposes. 

> [!NOTE]
> BO - Suggest adding a sentence just to tie this point off. Something about how metadata is important because it allows us to maximise the potential and impact of data. <br>
> :large_blue_diamond: KR added, mark as complete? <br>
> :large_blue_diamond: * note, this section references DDIwFAIR doc

## Defining metadata terms

So, now we know what metadata is and how it can help us, but how is it formally defined?

As an evolving field, it is importnant to note that terminology around metadata can vary depending on the source you are using. The same term can be used or interpreted by people to mean slightly different things. 

In this module we will define different metadata concepts and terms as we go along. Outside of this module, using a glossary or terminiology bank can be a useful way to identify a single source of truth so you can be consistent in your metadata processes.
  
For example, you could use [CoData RDM Terminiology bank](https://codata.org/initiatives/data-science-and-stewardship/rdm-terminology-wg/). Alternatively, there might be key organisations in your discipline who provide similar resrouces.

>[!NOTE]
> Should we/can we include other metadata glossaries/terminology? **BO - depends how consistent they are with one another, it might create confusion if different gloassaries are conflicting but if they're complementary it might be ok. But it might be more helpful and less confusing to have one thing we constantly refer back to** <p></p>
>Should this be moved to the very top of the training to cover all concepts, not just metadata concepts? OR should this be moved to unit 1.1?

>[!NOTE]
> BO - maybe in the previous module when we're defining metadata we could tie this in. We could say that there are lots of different definitions and understandings of metadata and its associated terminology, and that in the next module (i.e. this one) we'll spend time unpacking and making sense of the terminology. But I might get to the end of this course and change my mind!
> :large_blue_diamond: Agree **KR TO MOVE TO PREVIOUS MODULE**

## Defining metadata

Metadata is a form of data documentation, you may have heard being defined as “data about data”. It provides a framework to describe and understand data, so that it can be used in an intelligent and meaningful way.

According to CODATA, metadata is ...
_'Data about data. It is data (or information) that defines and describes the characteristics of other data. It is used to improve the understanding and use of the data.'_

The National Information Standards Organization offers a similar definition ...
_“Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use, or manage an information resource. Metadata is often called data about data or information about information.” *_

As noted, we may come across slight variations in the way people and organisations define metadata.
At it's core, metadata supports three main purposes:

**Discovery**
- Metadata helps people to find relevant resources

**Understandability and context**
- Metadata helps us to quickly understand 
  
**Use and action**
describes the limits of reasonable use or what actions can be taken

Through doing this, metadata maximises the potential of data. Metadata creates more opportunity for data citations, secondary research and cross-study comparison. It is also helpful for your future self, to help you understand your own data in the future.

>[!NOTE]
> BO - I think this should be moved up, as I feel like we've zoomed into the details over the last few slides about what makes "metadata" metadata, and then this zooms right back out to a high-level overview of metadata. It could also be weaved into the existing content e.g. "maximising the potential of data" - I think I mentioned adding something like this a few slides up. And we've just mentioned the future self point above too. (Sorry I keep saying slides as that's how I'm used to talking about it! By slides I mean the new pages with headers). Maybe this should just be the three main uses of metadata, and the bit above is added to the other sections above? <br>
> :large_blue_diamond: Agree **KR TO ADD** 


> [!NOTE]
> BO - This feels a bit random and the tone is a bit more formal than the previous sections. Suggest changing to something like "So we know what metadata is and how it can help us, but how is it formally defined?". Then go into the different definitions. 

::: notes

If you’ve heard of metadata before, you’ll have likely heard the definition “data about data”.

## What is the difference between metadata and data documentation?

Metadata is a type of data documentation, however it has several key defining features. So, what makes metadata different from other forms of data documentation?

Consider these two descriptions of a dataset. 

Description one:
<img src="img/Age7Survey-textdescription.png" alt="Alt Text" width="500" height="250"> 

Description two:
<img src="img/age7surveymetadata.png" alt="Alt Text" width="500" height="400">

Both contain the same information, and both could be called 'data about data' or 'information about information'.

However, only one of these examples can be considered metadata. 

- What are the differences between these two descriptions?
- Which is most effective for data management? Why?
- Which description do you think is metadata? What features make it metadata?


> [!NOTE]
> BO - Love this example :) it's really helpful to visually see the difference. To link this to the next chunk of content, which goes into more detail about the difference between metadata and other forms of documentation, could we add a small sentence to the end of this or the start of the next bit to say there are several key defining features, then go on to talk about them? Just so there's more of a connection between the content, and so it's obvious to the audience that what we're talking about next are the key defining features of metadata.
> :large_blue_diamond: **KR TO ADD**

---

## Metadata is structured, machine-readable documentation

Let's explore the defining features of metadata and how these features offer us more functionality.

Metadata is **structured documentation** that is **machine-readable** and **machine-actionable**. 

**Structured** 
Rather than a long text block, metadata is structured information that is formatted into metadata elements.

A **metadata element** is the container that describes what information the metadata is convering.
  - e.g. 'Title', 'Alternate Title', 'Publisher', 'Date'<p></p>
A **metadata field** is the input area for a metadata element. Sometimes there are rules that dictate what values are allowed in a metadata field in order to make sure metadata is clean.
  - e.g. for the metadata elements above, the fields may be: 

**Machine-readable** and **machine-actionable**

> [!NOTE]
> BO - Can we add a sentence or a few words at the start, just to continue with the colloquial/friendly tone? 

>[!NOTE]
> Are these definitions (A) correct? (B) useful? Should a more general explanation be given?
> The structure (element) and the content (field)
> BO - Yes, but we could maybe use more plain language instead of or alongisde this. The way I think about metadata elements is that they're the type of metadata, it's like a label for the metadata. We can see this clearly in the Discovery screenshot and your examples in your definition. The way I think about metadata fields is what you've written - it's a space to input the content. Could we add an example to metadata fields, like you've done for elements? You could say something like e.g. only numeric values may be permitted. <br>
> :large_blue_diamond: **KR TO ADD** Label for the metadata
  
---

## Defining metadata

>[!NOTE]
> BO - The stuff below this is relate to metadata being machine readable/actionable, so can we change the opening sentence to be something about that rathe than being quite broad? We could use that sentence, or something like it, above where I mentioned that it'd be good to have a sentence to introduce what this next chunk of content is about.

  - For metadata to be machine readable, it must be structured according to a specific set of rules
    
  - By being structured and machine-actionable, metadata:
    - Standardises the content and structure of documentation, making it easier for computers to extract information from the metadata
    - Tells a computer what something is, how it relates to other things (“objects”), and what to do with it

::: notes

*Note*: A schema is a formal technique for organizing metadata

## By being structured and machine-readable, metadata allows us to ...

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Can this go with the bit above? There's not loads of content in either section, so I don't think it'd be too much. Or can we have an opening sentence? I think the bit in bold is fine i.e. "By being structured and machine-readable, metadata allows us to ..."...or maybe I'm getting confused...are the headers like the "opening sentence"? But sometimes we have a descriptive header and an opening sentence, which I find helpful.

 - Makes data management for researchers easier and more efficient, saving time and imrpvoing accuracy
    - Allows researchers to quickly discover, understand and access data
    - Helps your future self to understand your past research, preserving your data for continued use

- Organise our metadata into useful collections of information. For example, in the previous example, groups of metadata were organised into tabs: Sweep description, Coverage, Funding, Kind of Data, Dataset and Questionnaires.

- Store our data in data repositories
  
- Search data repositories/archives
  [screenshot of filters in a repository]
  
- Compare studies

## Metadata and FAIR [Written out]

FINDABLE makes it easier to discover and understand data.
- F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.
- F2. Data are described with rich metadata.
- F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
- F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.

ACCESSIBLE makes it easier to understand how to access the data. 
- A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol (open, free, universally implementable, allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure where necessary)
- A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
- _Note: data does not need to be open but metadata should be accessible._

INTEROPERABLE allows you to combine datasets for further research.
- I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
- I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.

## How do you feel about FAIR?

Test your confidence with FAIR and metadata awareness with Data Archiving and Networked Services [Fair Aware tool](https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl/)

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Just reading the sentence above, I'm not 100% sure what the tool does. Can we explain a bit more? I'm coming from the angle that if we were delivering this in person, we wouldn't need to add more text because we'd verbally explain it to the audience, but since the content will be online, we probably need to be more explicit and detailed by writing down some things we'd normally just say aloud when delivering in-person training.

## Why create metadata?

Metadata is the core component of Research Data Management (RDM) and should be included in all Data Management Plans (DMPs). 

Why else should we create metadata?

As metadata is a powerful tool and best practice for research, it may be **required** by other organisations such as ...
- Institutes (in your working contract or project agreements)
- Funding agencies (ensure reusability and meet FAIR requirements)
- Journals (as a condition for publishing)
- Supervisors (data citation to enhance researcher reputation)
- Projects (collaboration across agencies/organisations)

 >[!NOTE]
> BO - The first sentence feels a bit random, as we haven't talked about DMPs yet and we don't go on to talk about them in this section.
> :large_blue_diamond: Agree **KR TO ADD LINK TO DMPS** I don't think we need to explain them here as we cover them in 1.2 but we can link back to that section

## In short ...

Metadata allows you to realise the full potential of your data, increasing its value and making it go further.

Metadata is:
- A roadmap of your data
- A note for your future self
- A tool for collaboration with others
- A hallmark of data management best practice and transparency

## Summary

- Metadata is information that describes data
- Metadata is based on a structure that can be processed by a computer 
- Metadata is important for your future self and others to discover, understand and (re)use data
- Metadata allows researchers to use data effectively because it includes the important information needed to exploit the full potential of data

## Snippets from other trainings

Below are snippets from other trainings that may be useful to include here. For now they are not included in the main structure in order to avoid repetition.


Benefits of metadata for you as a researcher:
- Increases research efficiency
- Maximises potential of your data, leading to secondary research, data citations and cross study comparison
- Improves data quality and FAIRness
