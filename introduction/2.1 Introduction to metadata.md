## A mystery canned drink ... a metaphor

Imagine it's a hot day and you're very thirsty. You come across this sealed drink can on the side of a road ...

<img src="img/plain-can.png" alt="Alt Text" width="180" height="280">

Do you know what's inside the can? Would you want to drink it?

---

## A mystery canned drink ... a metaphor

Because the can doesn't have a label we don't know ...
- What's inside 
- Where it's come from
- When it was made or by who

It's unlikely that anyone will want to drink from that can and if they do, it's a risk!

---

## A mystery canned drink ... explained

Alternatively, if you came across this can in a local supermarket, would you know what is inside it? Would you be happy to drink it?

## A mystery canned drink ... explained

Most people would be more confident about what is inside the can as the packaging contains:

- The brand (producer)
- Description of the drink/flavour
- Ingredient list
- Nutrition
- Location of production
- Producer contact information
- Best before date

With this information you have a better insight into what's inside the can and whether you can trust it's contents and want to drink it.

The can is even more trustworthy if it's found in a shop you knew and trusted. If the drink was found on the side of the road you would probably wouldn't trust it contents and would avoid drinking it. However, if the can was stocked in a shop alongside other similar drinks, you could read the labels, compare products and make an informed decision about the drink you pick.

---
## How does the can relate to metadata ...

Imagine the liquid inside the can is a dataset. 

The information about the drink (the brand, location of production, ingredient list, nutrition etc.) is the metadata which tells us what the dataset is. 

Like the plain can, without any metadata, we don't know what the dataset consists of or the contextual information like _who_ conducted the research and _when_.

Similar to storing the can in the supermarket and comparing it with other cans, metadata repositories store metadata for different datasets in the same place. This allows us to search and compare across different datasets, seeing what data is most relevant for us as well as increase the trustworthiness of the data.

Let's consider this in a research context ...

- Let’s have a look at more of a contextualised example of how metadata can help us to understand and use data.
- On the slide is a screenshot of a dataset. 
- With the people on your table, please take a couple of minutes to discuss what information you would need in order to be able to understand and use this data.

## Some questions that might be asked to understand and use data

![](img/data_qu_themedbubbles.png "Alt text here")

---

## Finding information about datasets

Where would you find out the answers to these questions? Where would you look? Who would you contact?

---

## Metadata: answering essential quesitons

Through answering these questions, we start to create the metadata for this data.

As a starting point, metadata can be considered as the who/what/where/when/why/how of the data. 
- **Who** collected the data? 
- **What** data did they collect? 
- **When** was it collected? 
- **Where** was it collected? 
- **Why** was it collected? 
- **How** was it collected?

Metadata describes data, giving us the context we need to understand and interpret the data so we can use in an intelligent and meaningful way.

---

## Dataset: information about the study

Through answering the questions in the green bubbles, we start to create metadata about the study.

What is the study about:
- Title
- Subject
- Abstract

Who created the data:
- Creator
- Publisher

When was the data available:
- Date research started
- Date research completed
- Date made available

Where was the data collected:
- Country
- Region
- City

---

## Dataset: information about the data

Through answering the blue bubbles, we can also describe the data itself.

What do the column headings mean?
- Varibales

What do the numbers mean?
- Numeric values / codes
- Unit of measurement
- Missing data values

What type of data are they?
- Data type: numeric,

How was the data collected
- Data collection instrument


>[!NOTE]
>**I can't find variable labels for dataset above on CLOSER study page
> Should we include examples of the study / dataset metadata for the study? e.g. a screenshot of the study page / the table with the variable names included?

## What metadata can describe

Metadata provides information on 
 - Data e.g. the documents, images, datasets that make up the research
 - The concepts that our research relates to 
 - Real-world entities involved in the research e.g. people, organisations, places
 - Processes conducted to complete the research e.g. data collections, archiving, computation

---

## Challenges of not having this metadata

Without this metadata, we wouldn't be able to understand the dataset easily. We would have to engage with time-consuming processes such as contacting people or organisations to get further information about dataset and what it conveys. 

While some information about data exists in research papers and outputs, it may take time to find and extract the information you need, or the information may be incomplete. Also, the purpose of a paper is to report the findings of a particular research question, but data can be reused to answer more research questions than the one it was originally intended to measure.

---

## Defining metadata

Drawing from the example, how do we define metadata ...

- Metadata is a form of data documentation 
- People often descirbe metadata as “data about data”
- Provides a framework to describe and understand data, so that it can be used in an intelligent and meaningful way
  
_“Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use, or manage an information resource. Metadata is often called data about data or information about information.” *_ - National Information Standards Organization

According to CODATA, metadata is _'Data about data. It is data (or information) that defines and describes the characteristics of other data. It is used to improve the understanding and use of the data.'_

::: notes

If you’ve heard of metadata before, you’ll have likely heard the definition “data about data”.
Wikipedia has a slightly different take… (e.g. the date and time of a text message is metadata, but the text of that message is not)

(2) https://dataedo.com/kb/data-glossary/what-is-metadata
(3) Wikipedia “data that provides information about other data, but not the content of the data itself” [3] -- https://www.britannica.com/technology/metadata

## What is the difference between metadata and data documentation?

What makes metadata different from other forms of data documentation?

Consider these two descriptions of a dataset. 

<img src="img/Age7Survey-textdescription.png" alt="Alt Text" width="500" height="250"> 
<img src="img/age7surveymetadata.png" alt="Alt Text" width="500" height="400">

Both contain the same information and both could be called 'data about data' or 'information about information'.

However, only one of these examples can be considered metadata. 

- What are the differences between these two descriptions?
- Which format is most effective for data management? Why?
- Which description do you think is metadata? What features make it metadata?

---

## Metadata is structured data

The data is broken down into metadata elements and fields rather than a long text block.

- A **metadata element** is the container that describes what information the metadata is convering.
  - e.g. 'Title', 'Alternate Title', 'Publisher', 'Abstract'
- A **metadata field** is the input area for a metadata element. Sometimes there are rules that dictate what values are allowed in a metadata field in order to make sure metadata is clean.

>[!NOTE]
>Are these definitions (A) correct? (B) useful? Should a more general explanation be given?
  
---

## Defining metadata

Metadata is a type of data documentation however it has specific features.

  - Metadata is **structured documentation** that is **machine-readable**
  - For metadata to be machine readable, it must be structured according to a specific set of rules
    
  - By being structured and machine-readable, metadata:
    - Standardises the content and structure of documentation, making it easier for computers to extract information from the metadata
    - Tells a computer what something is, how it relates to other things (“objects”), and what to do with it

::: notes

*Note*: A schema is a formal technique for organizing metadata

:::

---

## By being structured and machine-readable, metadata allows us to ...

 - Makes data management for researchers easier and more efficient, saving time and imrpvoing accuracy
    - Allows researchers to quickly discover, understand and access data
    - Helps your future self to understand your past research, preserving your data for continued use

- Organise our metadata into useful collections of information. For example, in the previous example, groups of metadata were organised into tabs: Sweep description, Coverage, Funding, Kind of Data, Dataset and Questionnaires.

- Store our data in data repositories
  
- Search data repositories/archives
  [screenshot of filters in a repository]
  
- Compare studies 

---

## Purpose of metadata

Metadata provides the information needed for people to efficiently discover, understand and (re)use data, making your data go further. By maximising the potential of data, metadata creates more opportunity for data citations, secondary research and cross-study comparison. It is also helpful for your future self, to help you understand your own data in the future.

- Metadata supports three main uses:
  - Understandability and context - it helps to convey the meaning of resources
  - Use and action - it describes the limits of reasonable use or what actions can be taken
  - Discovery - it helps people to find relevant resources


::: notes

- This example shows us how metadata is necessary to understand someone else’s data, but it’s also good to consider how this information might be useful for your future self when working on your own data, so you don’t end up in a Sam1 situation!
- Capturing this information (or metadata) means that the data is available for re-use, and it also makes it machine-actionable to make data management easier and more efficient, and the data more discoverable.

## Benefits of metadata 

For people creating metadata, metadata:
- Preserves your data and research
- Makes data management processes more robust and efficient
- Enables more accurate, reliable and higher-quality research results
- Helps your future self understand and reuse the data
- Helps others find, understand, compare, and use your data
- Increases the visibility of your study to other researchers and organisations
- Exploits the full potential of your data by supporting cross study and secondary research processes

For people using metadata:
- Understand data efficiently and effectively
- Assess how relevant the data is for us
- Compare the dataset with other datasets
- Reproduce or reuse the data
- Save time by not having to contact people for basic information around the dataset

For research as a whole:
- Saves time for people working across the research field
- Provides proof of transparent and valid conduct
- Implements FAIR data principles
- Enacts best practice in research


::: notes

As well as external factors, metadata is helpful for your future self, to help you understand your data later down the line, and be able to share it in a meaningful way with others.

## Metadata and FAIR

Thinking back to FAIR data principles, we can now see how metadata is a vital tool that underpins each principle.

## Metadata and FAIR [Written out]

FINDABLE makes it easier to discover and understand data.
- F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.
- F2. Data are described with rich metadata.
- F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
- F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.

ACCESSIBLE makes it easier to understand how to access the data. 
- A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol (open, free, universally implementable, allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure where necessary)
- A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
- _Note: data does not need to be open but metadata should be accessible._

INTEROPERABLE allows you to combine datasets for further research.
- I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
- I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
- I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.

RE-USABLE enables re-use of your own data and re-use for others.
- R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
    - (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
    - (Meta)data are associated with their provenance.
    - (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.

## How do you feel about FAIR?

Test your confidence with FAIR and metadata awareness with Data Archiving and Networked Services [Fair Aware tool](https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl/)

---

## Why create metadata?

Metadata is the core component of Research Data Management (RDM) and should be included in all Data Management Plans (DMPs). 

Why else should we create metadata?

As metadata is a powerful tool and best practice for research, it may be **required** by other organisations such as ...
- Institutes (in your working contract or project agreements)
- Funding agencies (ensure reusability and meet FAIR requirements)
- Journals (as a condition for publishing)
- Supervisors (data citation to enhance researcher reputation)
- Projects (collaboration across agencies/organisations)

## Summary

- Metadata is information that describes data
- Metadata is based on a structure that can be processed by a computer 
- Metadata is important for your future self and others to discover, understand and (re)use data
- Metadata allows researchers to use data effectively because it includes the important information needed to exploit the full potential of data
