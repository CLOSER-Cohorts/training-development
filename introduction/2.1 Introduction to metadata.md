## A mystery canned drink ... a metaphor

Imagine it's a hot day and you're very thirsty. You come across this sealed drink can on the side of a road ...

<img src="img/plain-can.png" alt="Alt Text" width="180" height="280">

Do you know what's inside the can? Would you want to drink it?

---

## A mystery canned drink ... a metaphor

Because the can doesn't have a label, we don't know ...
- What's inside 
- Where it's come from
- When it was made
- Who made it

It's unlikely that anyone will want to drink from that can, and if they do, it's a risk!

---

## A mystery canned drink ... explained

Alternatively, if you came across this can in a local supermarket, would you know what is inside it? Would you be happy to drink it?

---

## A mystery canned drink ... explained

Most people would be more confident about what is inside the can, as the packaging contains:

- The brand (producer)
- Description of the drink and its flavour
- Ingredient list
- Nutritional information
- Location of production
- Producer contact information
- Best before date

With this information, you have a better insight into what's inside the can and whether you can trust its contents and want to drink it.

The can is even more trustworthy if it's found in a shop you know and trust. If the drink was found on the side of the road, you would probably wouldn't trust it contents and would avoid drinking it. However, if the can was stocked in a shop alongside other similar drinks, you could read the labels, compare the products, and make an informed decision about the drink you pick.

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Suggest removing "If the drink was found on the side of the road, you would probably wouldn't trust it contents and would avoid drinking it. However,", as we've already said the first bit before. So I'd include the first sentence followed by "If the can was stocked...". Love this metaphor and the way it's written, by the way!

>[!NOTE]
> Legally required information, what information is necessary and who is it important to/why
> Different information for different audiences - sugar, diabeties
> BO - not sure if you plan to include this info, but I actually think it reads fine as is and is a good entry point to metadata.

---
## How does the can relate to metadata ...

Imagine the liquid inside the can is a dataset. 

The information about the drink (the brand, location of production, ingredients list, nutritional information etc.) is the metadata which tells us what the dataset is. 

>[!NOTE]
> BO - I think the above sentence is a bit confusing, as we're swapping between the can and the dataset. Suggest removing, as the next sentence flows nicely from the first anyway.

Like the plain can, without any metadata, we don't know what the dataset consists of or the contextual information such as _who_ collected the data and _when_.

Similar to storing the can in the supermarket and comparing it with other cans, metadata repositories store metadata for different datasets in the same place. This allows us to search and compare across different datasets, assessing what data is most relevant for us, as well as increasing the trustworthiness of the data.

>[!NOTE]
> BO - I really like the point above, and I definitely think we should include it somewhere, but I think there'd be a better connection between the start of this section "...without metdata, we don't know what the dataset consists of..." and the next section "...what would you need to know in order to understand and use this data?", if we moved the repo bit somewhere else.

Let's consider this in a research context ...

- Let’s have a look at more of a contextualised example of how metadata can help us to understand and use data.
- On the slide is a screenshot of a dataset. 
- With the people on your table, please take a couple of minutes to discuss what information you would need in order to be able to understand and use this data.

## Some questions that might be asked to understand and use data

![](img/data_qu_themedbubbles.png "Alt text here")

---

## Finding information about datasets

Where would you find the answers to these questions? Where would you look? Who would you contact?

---

## Metadata: answering essential quesitons

Through answering these questions, we start to create the metadata for this data.

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Suggest changing the above sentence to something like "To answer these questions, we need metadata.", because if they're wanting to understand someone else's dataset like in the example above, they'd need to find the metadata, not create it, if that makes sense? The next WWWWWH part would still make sense if we changed this sentence.

As a starting point, metadata can be considered as the who/what/where/when/why/how of the data. 
- **Who** collected the data? 
- **What** data did they collect? 
- **When** was the data collected? 
- **Where** was the data collected? 
- **Why** was the data collected? 
- **How** was the data collected?

Metadata describes data, giving us the context we need to understand and interpret the data so we can use in an intelligent and meaningful way.

---

## Dataset: information about the study

Through answering the questions in the green bubbles, we start to create metadata about the study.

What is the study about:
- Title
- Subject
- Abstract

Who created the data:
- Creator
- Publisher

When was the data available:
- Date research started
- Date research completed
- Date made available

Where was the data collected:
- Country
- Region
- City

>[!NOTE]
> Why do you have this information? <p></p>
> E.g. having information around publisher and creator = trust, governance around data <p></p>
> Abstract gives rationale for data <p></p>
> Why do you want this metadata <p></p>
> Put more abstract rationales for the metadata <p></p>
> Examples of varying levels of information - which one would you trust more? <p></p>
> E.g. want to look at Scottish data (only UK specified) etc.

---

## Dataset: information about the data

Through answering the blue bubbles, we can also describe the data itself.

What do the column headings mean?
- Variables

What do the numbers mean?
- Numeric values / codes
- Unit of measurement
- Missing data values

What type of data are they?
- Data type: numeric, string

How was the data collected
- Data collection instrument


>[!NOTE]
>**I can't find variable labels for dataset above on CLOSER study page
> Should we include examples of the study / dataset metadata for the study? e.g. a screenshot of the study page / the table with the variable names included?

> [!NOTE]
> BO - Is the below the actual data? Or is it made up? It looks like it's the real data because you've added a link to the dataset in Discovery. We wouldn't want to include a real raw dataset in the training unless it's a publicly available training dataset. Is that what this is? Yes I think we should include an example of high-level metadata (i.e. study-level metadata), especially since we've talked about the WWWWWH of metadata, and the high-level stuff covers a lot of that.

## What metadata can describe

Metadata provides information on 
 - Data e.g. the documents, images, datasets that make up the research
 - The concepts that our research relates to 
 - Real-world entities involved in the research e.g. people, organisations, places
 - Processes conducted to complete the research e.g. data collections, archiving, computation

> [!NOTE]
> BO - Suggest moving this as the challenges flows nicely from the bit above. I think we should flesh it out too, so say something like metadata doesn't just describe datasets, it can also describe... and then go into the examples you've provided about the concepts etc and we could link this to the high-level metadata and add the study page example here.

---

## Challenges of not having this metadata

Without this metadata, we wouldn't be able to understand or use the dataset. We would have to engage with time-consuming processes, such as contacting people or organisations to get further information about the dataset and what it contains. 

While some information about data exists in research papers and outputs, it may take time to find and extract the information you need, or the information may be incomplete or unsuitable to facilitate reuse. Also, the purpose of a research paper is to report the findings of a particular research question, but data can be used to answer more research questions than the one it was originally intended to measure.

> [!NOTE]
> BO - Suggest adding a sentence just to tie this point off. Something about how metadata is important because it allows us to maximise the potential and impact of data.

---

## Defining metadata

Drawing from the example, how do we define metadata ...

> [!NOTE]
> BO - This feels a bit random and the tone is a bit more formal than the previous sections. Suggest changing to something like "So we know what metadata is and how it can help us, but how is it formally defined?". Then go into the different definitions. 

- Metadata is a form of data documentation 
- People often define it as “data about data”
- It provides a framework to describe and understand data, so that it can be used in an intelligent and meaningful way
  
_“Metadata is structured information that describes, explains, locates, or otherwise makes it easier to retrieve, use, or manage an information resource. Metadata is often called data about data or information about information.” *_ - National Information Standards Organization

According to CODATA, metadata is _'Data about data. It is data (or information) that defines and describes the characteristics of other data. It is used to improve the understanding and use of the data.'_

::: notes

If you’ve heard of metadata before, you’ll have likely heard the definition “data about data”.
Wikipedia has a slightly different take… (e.g. the date and time of a text message is metadata, but the text of that message is not)

(2) https://dataedo.com/kb/data-glossary/what-is-metadata
(3) Wikipedia “data that provides information about other data, but not the content of the data itself” [3] -- https://www.britannica.com/technology/metadata

## What is the difference between metadata and data documentation?

What makes metadata different from other forms of data documentation?

Consider these two descriptions of a dataset. 

<img src="img/Age7Survey-textdescription.png" alt="Alt Text" width="500" height="250"> 
<img src="img/age7surveymetadata.png" alt="Alt Text" width="500" height="400">

Both contain the same information, and both could be called 'data about data' or 'information about information'.

However, only one of these examples can be considered metadata. 

- What are the differences between these two descriptions?
- Which is most effective for data management? Why?
- Which description do you think is metadata? What features make it metadata?

> [!NOTE]
> BO - Love this example :) it's really helpful to visually see the difference. To link this to the next chunk of content, which goes into more detail about the difference between metadata and other forms of documentation, could we add a small sentence to the end of this or the start of the next bit to say there are several key defining features, then go on to talk about them? Just so there's more of a connection between the content, and so it's obvious to the audience that what we're talking about next are the key defining features of metadata.

---

## Metadata is structured data

The information is broken down into metadata elements, rather than a long text block.

> [!NOTE]
> BO - Can we add a sentence or a few words before this, just to continue with the colloquial/friendly tone? 

- A **metadata element** is the container that describes what information the metadata is convering.
  - e.g. 'Title', 'Alternate Title', 'Publisher', 'Abstract'
- A **metadata field** is the input area for a metadata element. Sometimes there are rules that dictate what values are allowed in a metadata field in order to make sure metadata is clean.

>[!NOTE]
> Are these definitions (A) correct? (B) useful? Should a more general explanation be given?
> The structure (element) and the content (field)
> BO - Yes, but we could maybe use more plain language instead of or alongisde this. The way I think about metadata elements is that they're the type of metadata, it's like a label for the metadata. We can see this clearly in the Discovery screenshot and your examples in your definition. The way I think about metadata fields is what you've written - it's a space to input the content. Could we add an example to metadata fields, like you've done for elements? You could say something like e.g. only numeric values may be permitted.
  
---

## Defining metadata

Metadata is a type of data documentation, however it has specific unique features.

>[!NOTE]
> BO - The stuff below this is relate to metadata being machine readable/actionable, so can we change the opening sentence to be something about that rathe than being quite broad? We could use that sentence, or something like it, above where I mentioned that it'd be good to have a sentence to introduce what this next chunk of content is about.

  - Metadata is **structured documentation** that is **machine-readable**
  - For metadata to be machine readable, it must be structured according to a specific set of rules
    
  - By being structured and machine-readable, metadata:
    - Standardises the content and structure of documentation, making it easier for computers to extract information from the metadata
    - Tells a computer what something is, how it relates to other things (“objects”), and what to do with it

::: notes

*Note*: A schema is a formal technique for organizing metadata

:::

---

## By being structured and machine-readable, metadata allows us to ...

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Can this go with the bit above? There's not loads of content in either section, so I don't think it'd be too much. Or can we have an opening sentence? I think the bit in bold is fine i.e. "By being structured and machine-readable, metadata allows us to ..."...or maybe I'm getting confused...are the headers like the "opening sentence"? But sometimes we have a descriptive header and an opening sentence, which I find helpful.

 - Makes data management for researchers easier and more efficient, saving time and imrpvoing accuracy
    - Allows researchers to quickly discover, understand and access data
    - Helps your future self to understand your past research, preserving your data for continued use

- Organise our metadata into useful collections of information. For example, in the previous example, groups of metadata were organised into tabs: Sweep description, Coverage, Funding, Kind of Data, Dataset and Questionnaires.

- Store our data in data repositories
  
- Search data repositories/archives
  [screenshot of filters in a repository]
  
- Compare studies

>[!NOTE]
> BO - I think we need a bit more detail for the last three points.

---

## Purpose of metadata

Metadata provides the information needed for people to efficiently discover, understand and (re)use data, making your data go further. By maximising the potential of data, metadata creates more opportunity for data citations, secondary research and cross-study comparison. It is also helpful for your future self, to help you understand your own data in the future.

- Metadata supports three main uses:
  - Understandability and context - it helps to convey the meaning of resources
  - Use and action - it describes the limits of reasonable use or what actions can be taken
  - Discovery - it helps people to find relevant resources


>[!NOTE]
> Store at bottom - should we repurpose or move to other slides

>[!NOTE]
> BO - I think this should be moved up, as I feel like we've zoomed into the details over the last few slides about what makes "metadata" metadata, and then this zooms right back out to a high-level overview of metadata. It could also be weaved into the existing content e.g. "maximising the potential of data" - I think I mentioned adding something like this a few slides up. And we've just mentioned the future self point above too. (Sorry I keep saying slides as that's how I'm used to talking about it! By slides I mean the new pages with headers). Maybe this should just be the three main uses of metadata, and the bit above is added to the other sections above?

## Metadata and FAIR

Thinking back to the FAIR data principles, we can now see how metadata is a vital tool that underpins each principle.

## Metadata and FAIR [Written out]

FINDABLE makes it easier to discover and understand data.
- F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.
- F2. Data are described with rich metadata.
- F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
- F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.

ACCESSIBLE makes it easier to understand how to access the data. 
- A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol (open, free, universally implementable, allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure where necessary)
- A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
- _Note: data does not need to be open but metadata should be accessible._

INTEROPERABLE allows you to combine datasets for further research.
- I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
- I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
- I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.

RE-USABLE enables re-use of your own data and re-use for others.
- R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
    - (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
    - (Meta)data are associated with their provenance.
    - (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.

## How do you feel about FAIR?

Test your confidence with FAIR and metadata awareness with Data Archiving and Networked Services [Fair Aware tool](https://fairaware.dans.knaw.nl/)

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Just reading the sentence above, I'm not 100% sure what the tool does. Can we explain a bit more? I'm coming from the angle that if we were delivering this in person, we wouldn't need to add more text because we'd verbally explain it to the audience, but since the content will be online, we probably need to be more explicit and detailed by writing down some things we'd normally just say aloud when delivering in-person training.

---

## Why create metadata?

Metadata is the core component of Research Data Management (RDM) and should be included in all Data Management Plans (DMPs). 

Why else should we create metadata?

As metadata is a powerful tool and best practice for research, it may be **required** by other organisations such as ...
- Institutes (in your working contract or project agreements)
- Funding agencies (ensure reusability and meet FAIR requirements)
- Journals (as a condition for publishing)
- Supervisors (data citation to enhance researcher reputation)
- Projects (collaboration across agencies/organisations)

 >[!NOTE]
> BO - The first sentence feels a bit random, as we haven't talked about DMPs yet and we don't go on to talk about them in this section.

Metadata is:
- A roadmap of your data
- A note for your future self
- A tool for collaboration with others
- A hallmark of data management best practice and transparency
