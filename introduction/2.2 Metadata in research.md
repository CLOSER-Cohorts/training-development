## Metadata terms

You may have come across metadata before or this may be your first time.

As we go deeper into understanding the role of metadata in research, it's important to consider terminology.

Sometimes the same terms can be used by different people to mean different things. Equally, you may come across new terms that you want to clarify.

Using a glossary or terminiology bank as a single source of truth so your metadata processes stay consistent.
  
For example, you could use [CoData RDM Terminiology bank](https://codata.org/initiatives/data-science-and-stewardship/rdm-terminology-wg/) 

Alternatively, there might be key organisations in your discipline who provide similar resrouces.

## Organising metadata

The world of metadata is expansive. 

Knowing what different levels and types of metadata you can create, can help you organise your metadata and check that you have captured necessary information to describe your data thoroughly.

---

## Levels of metadata

There are different levels of metadata. This refers to what the metadata is describing. 

**Project level**
- Describes the overall research project or study. This is the big-picture stuff — the who, what, why, when, and where of the entire research effort.

**Dataset level**
- Describes a specific dataset that was collected or created as part of the project. This is the mid-level detail that helps users understand how a particular dataset was constructed and how it should be used.

**Item level**
- Describes individual items within a dataset—specific files, images, rows, or observations. This is the fine-grain detail, useful for complex or multimedia datasets.

>[!NOTE]
>Would you call it Item level metadata or data level metadata?

## Where you find metadata in reseach settings 

Most commonly you will come across metadata in data and metadata repositories.

Repository pages often consist of metadata in order to give information on the research
- Project level:
- Dataset level:
- Item level:

The metadata are also leveraged as search and filter tools to help users discover research
- Variable search tool
- Keyword search tool

## Different types of metadata

Metadata elements can be grouped into certain types of metadata that serve a purpose in documentation. Below are some common types of metadata. 
_Note some metadata elements may serve multiple purposes and be included in multiple metadata types_

- Structural: Type of metadata that indicates how compound objects are put together. Examples include how pages are ordered to form chapters; how data are organised in a table; how datasets are organised in a collection.
  - [metadata element examples]
    
- Descriptive: Metadata that describe a dataset or resource in such a way that people can discover and identify it. Contains information that aids with findability.
  - Metadata element examples: creator(s), affiliation(s), title, abstract, keywords, persistent identifier, related publications
    
- Administrative: metadata used to manage administrative aspects of the digital objects such as intellectual property rights and acquisition. Also documents information concerning the creation, alteration, and version control of the metadata itself. This is sometimes known as meta-metadata.
  - [metadata element examples]
 
- Technical: Information describing the technical processes used to produce, or required to use a digital object.
  - [metadata element examples]
 
- Provenance: Information concerning the creation, attribution, or version history of managed data. Provenance metadata indicates the relationship between two versions of data objects and is generated whenever a new version of a dataset is created. Provenance information is gathered along the data lifecycle as part of curation processes.

## Identifying different levels of metadata

## Identifying different types of metadata

Let's take a look at the metadata for the [National Child Development Study](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.ncds/524c8f92-493f-4660-90c4-0aa7ac3d2640) (which includes the [Age 7 Survey (1965)](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.ncds/0103e4b4-09a6-41a8-997b-3ca0b1edcafc) we looked at in the last unit)

What different types of metadata can you identify?

>[!NOTE]
> Could also provide screenshots where they pick out different type of metadata.

## Identifying different types of metadata
_[Organise this list of metadata elements into structural, descriptive or administrative.]_

## Data type and metadata

The type of data will inform what metadata can be captured.

For example, while you can capture information about variables for a tabular dataset, you cannot capture this information for images or sounds.

Most obviously, metadata applies to data which has been collected for a specific purpose. 

For example:
  - Data captured through a measurement e.g. blood pressure
  - Data recorded through a question in a survey or census, or as part of an administrative process
  - Data captured through a device such as a location

Less obviously, it also applies to data such as text, images or sound which is processed into ‘numbers’ for statistical analysis

>[!NOTE]
> This needs attention. Want to describe how metadata applies to all forms of data however, having describing tabular data is more straightforward (and will be the thing we focus on

## How is metadata created?

Metadata is created in different ways:

- Automatically generated. For example:
  - Metadata software. for example: (This metadata stills needs to be verified by data managers and/or researchers)
- Maunually created, for example:

---

## When is metadata created?

Prospective metadata creation (upstream)

Retrospective metadata creation

---

## Who creates metadata?

Metadata creators 
- Researchers, data managers

Roles in metadata creation
- It is useful to have multiple people working on metadata creation and management so metadata can be quality assured

---

## What metadata do you need to create?

No research is too small for metadata. Even an individual project will benefit from having strong metadata. The more metadata you create, the more discoverable, accessible and (re)usable your data becomes. 

However depending on your resesources and how widely you want to share your data will determine what metadata you create and how much.

In our next unit, we will delve deeper into what metadata elements you could consider creating depending on you project size and aims. In this unit, we will cover on the metadata tools you should be aware of in order to implement best practice.

## Myths around creating metadata 

“Metadata is just optional admin work.”
Metadata  makes your research findable, accessible, and reusable (aka FAIR). Without it, your dataset is a mysterious can that no one wants to open — including your future self!

“I’ll just write it all down at the end.”
Waiting until the end of your project to write metadata is like trying to remember every ingredient you used in a meal you cooked six months ago. Create it as you go to capture crucial details while they’re fresh in your brain.

“Metadata is only for big datasets or labs.”
Even if you're a team of one with a single spreadsheet, metadata matters. It tells the story behind your data, so others (and you) can understand it later. 

“I know what my variables mean and they have a structured code, so everyone will understand them too.”
You might know that V1_Res stands for "Response variable for phase 1", but your collaborators (or peer reviewers) won't. Always explain acronyms, codes, units, and scale. You will save others and your future self a lot of work.

“I don't have time to create.”
Creating metadata can take time—if you wait until the end. But tools like DMPTool, Dataverse, and Open Science Framework help make metadata entry fast. Start small and build as you go. Invest a little time now, save a lot of confusion later

“There’s no standard way to do metadata in my field.”
Most fields have metadata standards (e.g., Dublin Core, DataCite, Darwin Core, DDI). Not sure what yours is? A librarian or data steward can help. If you’re totally unsure, any clear, structured documentation is better than none.

“I can’t share metadata until my data is published.”
Metadata can be shared early to build visibility and interest in your project. Plus, early sharing supports collaboration and feedback.


- Increased workload
- Time consuming and resource heavy
- Limited usability
- Not relevant for your data
