## Using metadata to discover and understand data

In this unit, we will explore how we can use metadata as an effective tool to discover and understand research projects and their data.

First, lets look at discovery. When do we need find research projects and data?

We may need to find research projects and data to ...
- Conduct literature reviews and understand how a new project will fit into existing research
- Help inform the design process of a new research project
- Collect secondary data for a new research project
- Help produce materials such as policy briefings

So, how do we go about finding data? 

Imagine you're a social science researcher looking at population and climate. You want to conduct research into approaches and case studies of improving water quality in cities in the UK. You are considering working from secondary data and you want to find open data from the years 2000-2025 that relate to this.

How would you go about it? What tools would you use?

>[!NOTE]
> Not sure if this is the best example for the dataset search activity. Happy to go with another one that is suggested.

## Tools to discover research

One common way people discover research is through data repositories and data catalogues. Data repositories and data catalogues are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are different tools.

**Data repository** <br>
The UK Data Service describes a data repository as 'a centralised database system that collects, manages, and stores datasets for later use'. They are designed for the long-term storage of datasets which can then be managed and accessed through the repository. 

**Data catalogue** <br>
CODATA defines a data catalogue as a 'curated collection of metadata records describing datasets and their data elements. Curated and organised using a formal metadata schema appropriate to data and data sets (e.g. ReCollect etc).'. Sometimes a data catalogue is referred to as a metadata repository (note that this is different from a data repository which stores the actual data). <p></p>

The main difference between the two tools is that a data repository stores the actual data, whereas a data catalogue stores the metadata records only. Data catalogues and data repositories can be cross-discipline or discipline specific.

When we are looking for data, it is normally a data catalogue we will be searching. We can then look to access a dataset through a data repository.

## Tools to discover research

Thinking back to the question, how do we use a data repository or cataglogue to find relevant research projects relating to our brief.

For example ...

First, we would find a relevant data catalogue. Here, we chose the data catalogue UK Data Service. This stores metadata for economic, population, and social research data in the UK.

We could put 'water quality' in the search bar ...

<img src="img/Water quality - search.png" alt="Alt Text" width="400" height="600"> 

To refine our search further, we could set the filters to reflect the brief (e.g. 2000-2025, Natural environment, Open data) ...

<img src="img/Water quality - filters.png" alt="Alt Text" width="400" height="600"> 

In these examples, how do you think we are using metadata to help us discover relevant research projects?

## The role of metadata in data catalogues

The reason we can search and filter data repositories and data catalogues is because each research project has metadata. Without it, we would have to click into every individual research project to understand what it is about and whether it is relevant for us. Instead metadata can be leveraged as a discovery tool allowing us to tailor our searches.

**Keywords search tool** <p></p>
Metadata enables people to find resources based on keywords or dates.


**Filter tool** <p></p>
Metadata terms can also be leveraged as filters to explore a large set of objects or data. 

These filters could manage high level metadata, for example:


Or they could filter low level metadata, for example:


Outside of research, we use metadata as a discovery tool all the time. For example on shopping sites, the filters we use to find the product we're after are metadata that have been used to described the product.

## Finding a data repository or catalogue for your research

As we touched on, data catalogues  can be cross-discipline or discipline specific. So, how can you find the right data catalogue and data repository for your area of interest? 

_[Point to resources where people can search and find data catalogue and repositories - re3data, FAIRSharing]_

Now, using the resource above, find data catalogues and/or repositories that are relevant to your area of interest or research.

## Discovery to understanding 

Once we have used the search and filter functions on a data repository or data catalogue to find relevant research projects, how can we use metadata to further _understand_ what a research project is about?

When we click through to a particular research project, we are taken to their profile page. Here, we can see the high level metadata for the project, providing a clear overview of what the project is about, when it was conducted and how we can access the data.

For example:

_[Provide a screenshot of a research profile on a catalogue/repository. Also provide a link to this page.]_

Now take look at different research projects across the data catalogue. What can you observe about the documentation/information around different research projects? Is it similar or different?

Data catalogues will often specify what metadata research projects need to provide when they deposit their data. This means the same level of information is provided for all resources so people using the data repository or data catalogue will get an even experience and be able to search efficiently. We will also look at other tools that are used to standardise metadata in the upcoming units 2.5 and 2.6.

## Understanding research projects in more detail

While research project profile pages are useful, they generally provide high level metadata only.

For example, if had a look at this research page on XXX [Give link to research project profile page], what could you tell someone about the actual data it collected?

Would you be able to describe what variables are within the dataset? Or how many cases it recorded for each variable?

>[!NOTE]
> Need to be concious here of the fact metadata repositories will list variables directly within the repository so you can search and filter them.

Sometimes we can interact with low level metadata directly on the site.

Another way we can we can access low level metadata is through additional documentation stored alongside datasets. This documentation are called codebooks or data dictionaries. These can be stored as downloadable resources on data repository and catalogue sites on the research project profile page. For example ...


>[!NOTE]
> KR Q: want to check, on the UK data service, is the data catalogue separate to the [variable and question bank](https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/variables)? So within UK data service website, they have both a data catalogue and a data repository

## Understanding research: Codebooks and data dictionaries

What information do codebooks and data dictionaries cover?

Both codebooks and data dictionaries aggregate low level metadata in order to give a robust overview of what data is included in a research project or dataset. If a project didn't have this metadata, it would not be possible to create these types of documentation. Often, codebooks and data dictionaries can be generated automatically from metadata that is already created and managed as part of the resource process.

While they are sometimes used interchangeably however they are different tools.

**Codebooks**<p></p>
UK Data Service defines a Codebook as a document that 'describes the contents, structure, and layout of a data collection. Codebooks begin with basic front matter, including the study title, name of the principal investigator(s), table of contents, and an introduction describing the purpose and format of the codebook. Some codebooks also include methodological details, such as how weights were computed, and data collection instruments, while others, especially with larger or more complex data collections, leave those details for a separate user guide and/or data collection instrument.'

**Data dictionaries**<p></p>
CoData defines Data dictionary as a 'collection of descriptions of the data objects or items in a data model. After each data object or item is given a descriptive name, its relationship is described (or it becomes part of some structure that implicitly describes relationship), the type of data (such as text or image or binary value) is described, possible predefined values are listed, and a brief textual description is provided. This collection can be organised for reference into a data dictionary.'

_[ADD A CLEAR LINE ABOUT THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO]_

>[!NOTE]
> Is it necessary to differentiate between Codebook and Data Dictionary in this course? If so, what is the difference we would like to identify? The terms are used interchangeably by many orgs so would be good to get a clear understanding of this as I'm struggling

## Using Codebooks and data dictionaries

_In progress section_

Add information about:
- Where you can find codebooks/data dictionaries and how you can access them
- Give an example of a codebook/data dictionary and ask what information you can gain from them (could tie to an activity e.g. ask people to find information about a particular variable, e.g. how many missing cases)
