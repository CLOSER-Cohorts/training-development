## Using metadata to discover and understand data

In this unit, we will explore how metadata can be used as a tool to discover and understand research projects and their data.

First, lets look at discovery. When do we need find research projects and data?

We may need to find research projects and data to ...
- Conduct literature reviews and understand how a new project will fit into existing research
- Help inform the research design and data collection process of a new research project
- Collect secondary data for a new research project
- Help produce materials such as policy briefings

So, how do we go about finding data? 

Imagine you're a social science researcher looking at population and climate. You want to conduct research into approaches and case studies of improving water quality in cities in the UK. You are considering working from secondary data and you want to find open data from the years 2000-2025 that relate to this subject.

How would you go about it? What tools would you use?

>[!NOTE]
> Not sure if this is the best example for the dataset search activity. Happy to go with another one that is suggested.

## Tools to discover research

One common way people discover research is through data repositories and data catalogues. Data repositories and data catalogues are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are different tools.

**Data repository** <br>
The UK Data Service describes a data repository as 'a centralised database system that collects, manages, and stores datasets for later use'. They are designed for the long-term storage of datasets which can then be managed and accessed through the repository. 

**Data catalogue** <br>
CODATA defines a data catalogue as a 'curated collection of metadata records describing datasets and their data elements. Curated and organised using a formal metadata schema appropriate to data and data sets (e.g. ReCollect etc).'. Sometimes a data catalogue is referred to as a metadata repository (note that this is different from a data repository which stores the actual data). <p></p>

The main difference between the two tools is that a data repository stores the actual data, whereas a data catalogue stores the metadata records only. When a researcher finishes a project, it is good practice to deposit data in a trusted repository to ensure it's long-term preservation (note, this does not mean data needs to be open). When data is deposited in a repository, it then becomes searchable on associated data catalogue sites.

Therefore, when we are looking for data, we will normally search a data catalogue. We can access dataset through a data repository site.

Data catalogues and data repositories can be cross-discipline or discipline specific. How can you find the right data catalogue and data repository for your area of interest? 

To find data repositories and catalogues  for different disciplines can use search tools such as ...
- [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/)
- [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/)

Using the websites above, find data catalogues and/or repositories that are relevant to your area of interest or research. You can also talk to other researchers in your field to identify the leading data repository and/or catalogue for your discipline.

## Tools to discover research

Thinking back to the question, how do we use a data cataglogue to find relevant research projects relating to our brief.

For example ...

First, we would find a relevant data catalogue. As the brief states we are a social science researcher, we chose the data catalogue UK Data Service. The catalogue stores metadata for economic, population, and social research data in the UK.

We could put 'water quality' in the search bar ...

<img src="img/Water quality - search.png" alt="Alt Text" width="400" height="600"> 

To refine our search further, we could set the filters to reflect the brief (e.g. 2000-2025, Natural environment, Open data) ...

<img src="img/Water quality - filters.png" alt="Alt Text" width="400" height="600"> 

In these examples, how do you think we are using metadata to help us discover relevant research projects?

## The role of metadata in data catalogues

The reason we can search and filter data catalogues is because each research project has metadata. Without it, we would have to click into every individual research project to find the information to understand what it is about and whether it is relevant for us. Instead, metadata allows us to tailor our searches and conduct a high level review of many resources in a systematic way.

**Keywords search tool** <p></p>
When we enter terms into the search bar of a data catalogue, the computer looks for matches in a resource's metadata providing us with relevant search results.

Take a look at some examples of search pages on data catalogues here...
- [UK Data Service](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/?Search=#!?Search=&Page=1&Rows=10&Sort=0&DateFrom=440&DateTo=2025)
- [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/sites/icpsr/home)
- [CESSDA](https://datacatalogue.cessda.eu/)
- [CEDA](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/)
- [Office for National Statistics](https://ons.metadata.works/browser/landing)
- [ARIADNE](https://portal.ariadne-infrastructure.eu/)
- [DataMed](https://datamed.org/)
- [BioStudies](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/studies/)
- [BioSamples](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biosamples/)
- [ICES Metadata Catalogue](https://gis.ices.dk/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home)

**Filter tool** <p></p>
Metadata can also be leveraged as filters to explore a large set of objects or data. Most data catalogues will provide filters around high level metadata that describes the research project or resource. For example, depending on the website, you can filter by features such as topics, organisations, country, access, format or dates. 

For example ...

<img src="img/UKDS-Filters.png" alt="Alt Text" width="180" height="280">

Take a look at the data catalogues listed above and see what different filters they provide.

Some sites will also allow you to search and filter low level metadata about the data within the resources themselves. For example...
- [UK Data Service: Variable and question bank](https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/variables) allows users to search the variables and questions within datasets and data collection tools
- [CLOSER Discovery: Variable and question search](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/) also offers users to search through variable and question metadata.
  
Outside of research, we use metadata as a discovery tool all the time. For example on shopping sites, the filters we use to find the product we're after are metadata that have been used to described the product.

## Discovery to understanding 

Once we have used the search and filter functions on a data repository or data catalogue to find relevant research projects, how can we use metadata to further _understand_ what a research project is about?

When we click through to a particular research project, we are taken to their profile page. 

For example...

<img src="img/Water quality - profile page.png" alt="Alt Text" width="360" height="320"> 

Here, we can see the high level metadata for the project, providing a clear overview of what the project is about, when it was conducted and how we can access the data.

Data catalogues will often specify what metadata people need to provide when they deposit their data. This means the same level of information is provided across all resources so people using the data catalogue can easily compare resources and search efficiently. We will also look at other tools that are used to standardise metadata in the upcoming units [2.5](<2.5 Controlled vocabularies.md>) and [2.6](<2.6 Metadata standards.md>) .

## Understanding research projects in more detail

Data catalogues most commonly provide high level metadata. As we explored in [unt 2.1](<2.1 Introduction to metadata.md>), having both metadata about the research project (high level metadata) and the data and data collection processes (low level data) is useful for being able to fully understand a research project.

So, how do we find metadata about data?

As we touched on above, we may use low level metadata as filters to find specific research project. On some sites we can then interact with low level metadata directly online. For example....

- You can look at metadata for an individual variable, such as response options or linked questions, on UK Data Service Variable and Question Bank e.g. Variable ['Past health problems - 5'](https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk//variables/variable/?id=9323_V230) 
- You can find similar information on CLOSER Discovery e.g. Variable ['(A1) Did CM receive housing benefit whilst at address'](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.cls.ncds/c440796b-67e0-4d0c-b7da-6e4e28d0bfe2)

Another way we can we can access low level metadata is through additional documentation stored alongside datasets. This documentation are called codebooks or data dictionaries. These can be stored as downloadable resources on data repository and data catalogue sites on the research project profile page. For example ...

## Understanding research: Codebooks and data dictionaries

What information do codebooks and data dictionaries cover?

Both codebooks and data dictionaries aggregate low level metadata in order to give a robust overview of what data is included in a research project or dataset. If a project didn't have this metadata, it would not be possible to create these types of documentation. Often, codebooks and data dictionaries can be generated automatically from metadata that is already created and managed as part of the resource process.

While they are sometimes used interchangeably however they are different tools.

**Codebooks**<p></p>
UK Data Service defines a Codebook as a document that 'describes the contents, structure, and layout of a data collection. Codebooks begin with basic front matter, including the study title, name of the principal investigator(s), table of contents, and an introduction describing the purpose and format of the codebook. Some codebooks also include methodological details, such as how weights were computed, and data collection instruments, while others, especially with larger or more complex data collections, leave those details for a separate user guide and/or data collection instrument.'

For example, take a look at this codebook on ...

<img src="img/DISH-Codebook.png" alt="Alt Text" width="360" height="320"> 

**Data dictionaries**<p></p>
CoData defines Data dictionary as a 'collection of descriptions of the data objects or items in a data model. After each data object or item is given a descriptive name, its relationship is described (or it becomes part of some structure that implicitly describes relationship), the type of data (such as text or image or binary value) is described, possible predefined values are listed, and a brief textual description is provided. This collection can be organised for reference into a data dictionary.'

For example, take a look at this data dictionary here ...

<img src="img/DISH-Data-dictionary.png" alt="Alt Text" width="360" height="320"> 

>[!NOTE]
> Is it necessary to differentiate between Codebook and Data Dictionary in this course? If so, what is the difference we would like to identify? The terms are used interchangeably by many orgs so would be good to get a clear understanding of this as I'm struggling
