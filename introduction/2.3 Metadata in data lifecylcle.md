>[!NOTE]
> KR I feel the tone in this unit talks more to metadata creators (master students, researchers and data managers). For example, I use 'you should ...' or 'your data .../your research ...' etc. <p></p>
> Should I generalise it so it speaks also to funders and people who will not be directly involved in the metadata creation process?

## Intended learning outcomes

- Know the different stages of the research data lifecycle
- Understand how metadata supports the research data lifecycle
- Know how metadata creation and management relates to the research data lifecycle

## Can you name 6 stages in the research data lifecycle?

Try breaking down the research data lifecycle into 6 stages.

Name each stage and suggest what research activities might happen in each of them. 

Place each stage in chronological order.

::: notes
Task: step 1: ask participants to name 6 stages of data lifecycle.
step 2: ask participants to place 6 stages in order (don't specify shape)

## Data lifecycle

In this unit, we will look at the 6 stages outlined in the GSBPM Data Lifecycle Model. 

**Design &rarr; Data collection &rarr; Data management &rarr; Archive & disseminate &rarr; Analysis &rarr; Publication**

You may have come up with similar stages or something slightly different, for example like the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/) has it's own interpretation of the research data lifecycle.

While the titles of the stages may change, the research data lifecycle is often concieved as a circle. Why do you think that is?

>[!NOTE]
> KR Should we use UKDS Data lifecycle model or GSBPM data lifecycle model? (above is GSBPM) <p></p>
KR Should we add different activities that happen in each stage of the data lifecycle? (To complete when we confirm which model we use) <p></p>
> **KR -> JJ** Do you know where the original GSBPM Data lifecycle model is? I can find variations of the one above online but not those exact stages. The one I can find is a 8 stage process: specify needs, design, build, collect, process, analyse, disseminate, evaluate <p></p>
> KR If we use UKDS, it woudld reference the following: [Data ifecycle](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/) which has a corresponding [training video here.](https://youtu.be/-wjFMMQD3UA)

## Research data lifecycle: a circle

By placing the lifecycle stage's in a circle, we highlight the idea that research is an ever evolving process. For example, data or the documentation around the data can be updated or added to. As research processes are complex, you may go through the lifecycle stages multiple times in a single project. 

Data has the potential to serve many research activities beyond the original project. The cyclical view of the data lifecycle suggests how, with good data practices,  existing data can lead to new research questions, secondary research and cross-stduy comparison, supporting reproducibility and long-term value of the data.

## Which stage includes metadata?

All of them! Metadata is a vital tool throughout any research effort. Having strong metadata helps people outside a project who are engaging with research data (metadata users) as well as researchers and data managers within a project who are managing data (metadata creators). 

AS such, the creation, management and use of metadata should be integrated in all areas of the research data lifecycle.

## How metadata helps the research process

Research can be a disconnected process. Information about data or research activities can be lost at different stages or stored in silos, such as with an individual or a certain team.

Trying to collect information about a research process at the end of a project can be time consuming and inaccurate, as you have to work from memory or compile different documentation files from different sources. 

By creating metadata we build a coherent story of data, documenting the research process from the very start. This documentation is centralised so everyone can access the up-to-date information about a project. For large research teams, this can be a great tool for ensuring people are on the same page. For people engaging with a research project, having strong metadata increases it's transparency and the trustworthiness, meaning they are more likely to cite and re-use the data.

**Metadata connects up the research process.** 
Metadata can connect and accumulate information throughout the research process, building on previous information to document the whole data lifecycle in a coherent way, benefitting people both within a research project and externally.

**Metadata documents different versions and iterations of data.**
Metadata captures when data or the documentation around data are updated or changed. This gives a clear picture of the evolution of (meta)data in a research project and beyond, increasing it's transparency and credibility. 

**Creating metadata throughout each stage of the research data lifecycle saves time.**
Creating metadata from the very start of the data lifecycle allows you to build on information you've already captured and re-use metadata terms where necessary. This not only saves you time but ensures your metadata is consistent. Creating metadata as it happens further increases it's quality as you capture information while it's fresh, rather than trying to remember all the details at the end of a research project.

>[!NOTE]
> KR Maybe this offers too much detail? It's the lead to bringin in provenance but I feel it may be repeating itself a bit.

## Metadata, the data lifecycle and creating provenance

By creating metadata throughout the data lifecycle, you build robust data provenance.

Provenance is a type of metadata that documents the historical record of data as it moves through various stages, processes and transformations in the data lifecycle. It allows us to know exactly where the data has come from and how it has come about. 

As you develop metadata throughout the data lifecycle the quality of your provenance metadata will increase as you will build historical

Data provenance enhances transparency, trust, credibility and reproducibility of data by providing details such as who created the data, the history of modifications and who made those changes.

## Metadata

>[!NOTE]
> I feel like we have had a lot of acquisition in this unit and I'm wondering if we could create an activity around provenance as that is the main takeaway for this unit <p></p>
> Maybe we could do a comparison between two metadata sets, one has good provenance and one doesn't? We could ask participants which one they would trust most and why

## Using metadata to help start your research process

If you are doing primary research, looking at previous research to inform your study design and data collection method can be helpful. 

If you are doing secondary research, finding the right datasets for your inquiry is a fundamtental part of your planning and data collection stage. You may also need to find data for other forms of enquiry outside of the research space, for example for policy briefings.

However, finding the right data can be time consuming. If datasets have incomplete or low quality metadata, it is hard to know what a dataset contains and whether it will be useful for us. It's also difficult to understand how the data was collected and how your study could build on existing research.

How do might you use metadata from other previous research project's to help these processes?

## The role of metadata in discovering and understanding data 

**Discovery**

When robust metadata is available, you can search data repositories such [UK Data Service](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/) or metadata catalogues such as [CLOSER Discovery](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=www.closer.ac.uk&utm_campaign=Menu%20-%20search%20our%20data%20) to discover datasets effecitvely.

It is the project's metadata which enable the filter and search functions of these sites. When you want to look into a dataset more closely, further metadata helps you quickly understand what the data is about, what it measures and how the research was conducted.
