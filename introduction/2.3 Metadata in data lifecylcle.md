>[!NOTE]
> KR I feel the tone in this unit talks more to metadata creators (master students, researchers and data managers). For example, I use 'you should ...' or 'your data .../your research ...' etc. <p></p>
> Should I generalise it so it speaks also to funders and people who will not be directly involved in the metadata creation process? <p></p>
> BO - I quite like using phrases like your data/your research etc, as I think it fits in with the more personal/colloquial tone. I think the main audience will be individuals wanting to learn more about metadata, so I think it's fine.

## Research data lifecycle

Imagine you are planning a research project from beginning to end.

What are the different steps involved in this project? These steps are different stages of the research data lifecycle, which encapsulates the whole journey of research. 

Try breaking down the research data lifecycle into 6 stages and think about what research activities might happen at each step.

For example, the first step might be Research Design.

Activities in the Research Design stage could be:
- Create a data management plan (DMP). Within that DMP outline:
  - Roles and responsibilities
  - What you research project will aim to address
  - Timeline for the research project
  - Funding information
  - Data usage information

::: notes
Task: step 1: ask participants to name 6 stages of data lifecycle.
step 2: ask participants to place 6 stages in order (don't specify shape)
:::

>[!NOTE]
> BO - To fit in with the tone of the other modules, I think there needs to be a sentence or two to intro/give context to this e.g. "Imagine you are planning a research project from beginning to end. What are the different steps involved in this project? These different steps are different stages of the research data lifecycle. Can you name 6 stages of the research data lifecyle? ... " You could maybe give them one example to kick off with - might be helpful when they're doing this remotely and independently. <p></p>

## Data lifecycle

In this unit, we will look at the 6 stages outlined in the GSBPM Data Lifecycle Model. 

**Design &rarr; Data collection &rarr; Data management &rarr; Archive & disseminate &rarr; Analysis &rarr; Publication**

You may have come up with similar stages or something slightly different, for example like the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/) has its own interpretation of the research data lifecycle.

While the titles of the stages may change, the research data lifecycle is often concieved as a circle. Why do you think that is?

>[!NOTE]
> KR Should we use UKDS Data lifecycle model or GSBPM data lifecycle model? (above is GSBPM) <p></p>
KR Should we add different activities that happen in each stage of the data lifecycle? (To complete when we confirm which model we use) <p></p>
> **KR -> JJ** Do you know where the original GSBPM Data lifecycle model is? I can find variations of the one above online but not those exact stages. The one I can find is a 8 stage process: specify needs, design, build, collect, process, analyse, disseminate, evaluate <p></p>
> KR If we use UKDS, it woudld reference the following: [Data ifecycle](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/) which has a corresponding [training video here.](https://youtu.be/-wjFMMQD3UA) <p></p>
> Another good research data lifecycle plan is [LMA Research Data Management Working group](https://sunyolis.libguides.com/c.php?g=1290338&p=9475793#:~:text=Research%20Data%20Management%20is%20a,at%20the%20Plan%20%26%20Design%20phase.)
> BO - I think go with UKDS, and yes I like the idea of adding different activities at each stage. <p></p>

## Research data lifecycle: a circle

By placing the research data lifecycle stages in a circle, we highlight the idea that research is an ever evolving process. For example, data, or the documentation around the data, can be updated or added to. As research processes are complex, you may go through the lifecycle stages multiple times in a single project. 

Data has the potential to serve many research activities beyond the original project. The cyclical view of the data lifecycle suggests how, with good data practices, existing data can lead to new research questions, secondary research and cross-study comparisons, supporting reproducibility and long-term value of the data. 

---

## Which stage includes metadata?

All of them! Metadata is a vital tool throughout data lifecycle. Having strong metadata helps people outside a project who are engaging with research data (metadata users), as well as researchers and data managers within a project who are managing data (metadata creators). 

With that in mind, the creation, management, and use of metadata should be integrated in all areas of the research data lifecycle.

## How metadata helps the research process

Research can be a disconnected process. Information about data or research activities can be lost at different stages or stored in silos, such as with an individual or a certain team.

Trying to collect information about a research process at the end of a project can be time consuming and inaccurate, as you have to work from memory or compile different documentation files stored in different places.

By creating metadata, we build a coherent story of the data, documenting the research process from the very start. This documentation is centralised so everyone can access the up-to-date information about a project. For large research teams, this can be a great tool for ensuring people are on the same page. For an external individual engaging with your research, seeing strong metadata will demonstrate the project's transparency and increase it's trustworthiness, meaning they are more likely to cite and re-use the data.

## How metadata helps the research process

**Metadata connects the research process.** 
Metadata can connect and accumulate information throughout the research process, building on previous information to document the whole data lifecycle in a coherent way, benefitting people both within a research project and externally.

**Metadata documents different versions and iterations of data.**
Metadata captures when data or the documentation around data are updated or changed. This gives a clear picture of the evolution of (meta)data in a research project and beyond, increasing it's transparency and credibility. 

**Creating metadata throughout each stage of the research data lifecycle saves time.**
Creating metadata from the very start of the research data lifecycle allows you to build on information you've already captured and re-use metadata terms where necessary. This not only saves you time but ensures your metadata is consistent. Creating metadata as it happens further increases it's quality, as you capture information while it's fresh, rather than trying to remember all the details at the end of a research project.

>[!NOTE]
> KR Maybe this offers too much detail? It's the lead to bringin in provenance but I feel it may be repeating itself a bit.
> BO - I like it, but maybe we could combine the above bullet points with the section above, so the whole thing is in the format of headline and explanation? That might avoid the repetition.

## Map the metadata to the data lifecycle stage

While metadata will be created and updated throughout the data lifecycle, what type of metadata you capture will depend on what stage of the data lifecycle your in. For example, if you have just started your research and you are in the research design stage, you will not be able to capture metadata item-level metadata as you will not have collected your data yet!

Looking at the metadata elements below, at what stage of the data lifecycle do you think we will be able to capture this information?

- Author 
- Abstract
- Variable label
- Version

<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p></p>

</details>

>[!NOTE]
> BO - We could have an activity earlier on where we list different types of metadata and ask them to map them onto the research data lifecycle. This might help them consolidate ideas around what metadata can look like e.g. a high-level overview of the project (PI, funder) at the design stage, information about the questions asked at the data collection stage, information about the variables at the data analysis stage, etc. <p></p>
> :large_blue_diamond: KR Really like that idea, have moved this note to new section for this activity.

## Metadata, the data lifecycle and creating provenance

By creating metadata throughout the data lifecycle, you build robust data provenance.

Provenance is a type of metadata that documents the historical record of data as it moves through various stages, processes, and transformations in the data lifecycle. It allows us to know exactly where the data has come from and how it has come about. 

As you develop metadata throughout the research data lifecycle, the quality of your provenance metadata will increase as you will build historical [BO - something missing here...]

Data provenance enhances transparency, trust, credibility and reproducibility of data by providing details such as who created the data, the history of modifications and who made those changes.

## Provenance metadata

[Comparison activity, one showing a project that has good provenance and another that doesn't.


>[!NOTE]
> I feel like we have had a lot of acquisition in this unit and I'm wondering if we could create an activity around provenance as that is the main takeaway for this unit <p></p>
> Maybe we could do a comparison between two metadata sets, one has good provenance and one doesn't? We could ask participants which one they would trust most and why <p></p>

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Agree. I like the idea comparison activity idea.

## Using metadata to help start your research process

If you are doing primary research, looking at previous research to inform your study design and data collection method can be helpful. You may also need to identify research and datasets as part of your literature review.

If you are doing secondary research, finding the right datasets for your project is a core part of the planning and data collection stage. You may also need to find data for other forms of enquiry outside of the research space, for example for policy briefings.

However, finding the right data can be time consuming. If datasets have incomplete or low quality metadata, it is hard to know what a dataset contains and whether it will be useful for you. It's also difficult to understand how the data was collected and how your study could build on existing research.

How might you use metadata from previous research projects to help you conduct a literature review? Or identify datasets that you could use in secondary research.

>[!NOTE]
> BO - I think the question above is a bit vague - I'm not sure what "these processes" are.
>:large_blue_diamond: KR Have updated to more specific. Does this capture it better here?

## The role of metadata in discovering and understanding data 

**Discovering data**

When robust metadata is available, you can search data repositories such [UK Data Service](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/) or metadata catalogues such as [CLOSER Discovery](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=www.closer.ac.uk&utm_campaign=Menu%20-%20search%20our%20data%20) to discover datasets effecitvely. It is the project's metadata which enable the filter and search functions of these sites. 

**Understanding data**

When you want to look into a dataset more closely, further metadata helps you quickly understand what the data is about and how the research was conducted. It provides information on who produced the data and how the research was funded.

**Accessing data**

Metadata lets you know how to access data and who to contact if you have further questions around the research project.
