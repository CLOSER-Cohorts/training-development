## What are the 6 steps in the research data lifecycle?

Try breaking down the research data lifecycle into 6 stages.

Name each stage and suggest what research activities might happen in each of them. 

Place each stage in chronological order.

::: notes
[Task: step 1: ask participants to name 6 stages of data lifecycle.
step 2: ask participants to place 6 stages in order (don't specify shape)]

## Data lifecycle

In this unit, we will look at the 6 stages outlined in the GSBPM Data Lifecycle Model. You may have come up with similar stages or something slightly different, for example like the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/) also has provided it's own interpretation of the research data lifecycle.

While the titles of the stages may change, the research data lifecycle is often concieved as a circle. Why do you think that is?

> **KR -> JJ** Do you know where the original GSBPM Data lifecycle model is? I can find variations of the one above online but not those exact stages. The one I can find is a 8 stage process: specify needs, design, build, collect, process, analyse, disseminate, evaluate <p></P>

## Research data lifecycle: a circle

By placing the lifecycle stage's in a circle, we highlight the idea that research is an ever evolving. After data is collected, analysed, and shared, it can be reused, cited, or updated.

When a research project is complete, the utility of dataset shouldn't stop with it. This cyclical view of data highlights how good data practices at every stage supports future discovery, reproducibility, and long-term value of the data. Data can serve many research enquiries and purposes, beyond the original project. This leads to new research questions, secondary research, cross-stduy comparison and further data collection, spans from secondary research to cross study comparison and citations.

## Which stage includes metadata?

All of them! Metadata should be integrated in all areas of the research data lifecycle.

Having strong documentation helps both metadata users and metadata creators throughout the research data lifecycle.

## How metadata helps the research process

Research can be a disconnected process. Information can be lost at different stages of the data lifecycle.

**Metadata helps connect up the research process.** Metadata can connect and accumulate information as you go through the research process, allowing you to build on previous information and document the whole data lifecycle in a coherent and robust way.

**Metadata helps document different versions and iterations of data**, noting when elements are updated or changed. This gives a clear picture of the evolution of (meta)data in a research project and beyond.

**Creating metadata throughout each stage of the research data lifecycle saves time.**

So creating metadata consistently from the very start of the data lifecycle, increases the quality and utility of data documentation.

## Metadata, the data lifecycle and creating provenance

By creating metadata throughout the data lifecycle, you build robust data provenance.

Provenance is a type of metadata that documents the historical record of data as it moves through various stages, processes and transformations in the data lifecycle. It allows us to know exactly where the data has come from and how it has come about. 

As you develop metadata throughout the data lifecycle the quality of your provenance metadata will increase.

Data provenance enhances trust, credibility and reproducibility of data by providing details such as who created the data, the history of modifications and who made those changes.

## How you can use other studies' metadata to help your research process

If you are doing primary research, looking at previous research to inform your study design and data collection method can be helpful. If you are doing secondary research, finding the right datasets for your inquiry is a fundamtental part of your planning and data collection stage. You may also need to find data for other forms of inquiry outside of the research space, for example for policy briefings.

However, finding the right data can be time consuming. If datasets have incomplete or low quality metadata, it is hard to know what a dataset contains and whether it will be useful for us. It's also difficult to understand how the data was collected and how your study could build on existing research.

When robust metadata is available, you can search (meta)data repositories such [UK Data Service](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/) or [CLOSER Discovery](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=www.closer.ac.uk&utm_campaign=Menu%20-%20search%20our%20data%20), allowing you to discover datasets effecitvely.

The metadata enables the filter and search functions of these sites. When you want to look into a dataset more closely, further metadata helps you quickly understand what the data is about, what it measures and how the research was conducted.
