## Metadata management and best practice

As we touched on at the end of the last unit, metadata can be leveraged as a search and filter tool on platforms such as data repositories and data catalogues. This enables people to find data based on keywords, topics or dates. Through being machine actionable in this way, metadata is a powerful form of documentation that provides more functionality than unstructured documentation.

In order to be machine actionable, metadata needs to be structured and stored in appropriate machine readable formats.

In [unit 2.1](<2.1 Introduction to metadata.md>) we touched on machine readable formats that metadata should be stored in. This includes CSV, XML, JSON and MS Excel rather than free- text formats such as PDF or MS Word. By being in these formats, machines can search and filter metadata.

However, just because machines can read and process metadata doesn't mean that metadata is automatically valuable as a discovery tool.

For example, look at the screenshot below. Why are these filters not helpful? 
What could be the issues with the clothes' metadata that are causing problems with the filters?

## Bad metadata impacts discoverability and interoperability

Duplicate terms, spelling errors, wrongly placed categories impact metadata as a discovery tool.

<img src="img/Bad_metadata_circled.png" alt="Alt Text" width="400" height="600"> 

**[1+2]** Inconsistent or incorrect terms means metadata is less interoperable. Machines don't recognise that 'Shoees' and 'Shoes' are most likely the same object but that one has a spelling error. Instead, they are concieved as two separate categories. We run into similar issues when we use different terms for the same object. For example, 'Trainers' and 'Sneakers' are most likely referring to the same object. However, as they are different words, the computer creates separate categories. In both cases, objects under each category are not included in the same search or filter result. It's then up to the person searching on the site to notice the error, interpret the meaning of the categories and adjust their search accordingly.

**[3]** Vague and undefined metadata can also cause confusion. For example, in the screenshot above, what's the difference between 'light blue' and 'pale blue'? Are they the same colour? It's important to use terms that intuitively describe data and/or refer to a clear definition of that term in your metadata.

'Dirty' metadata can be a barrier to depositing your (meta)data in a data repository or data catalogue as it reduces the metadata's interoperability meaning the information cannot integrate with a centralised system.

---

## Impact of low quality metadata

Low quality metadata...<br>
- Hinders the searchability and discoverability of data
- Reduces the reliability and validity of data
- Reduces the interoperability of the data
- Harder to identify and compare similar objects
- Is time consuming as people have to identify what terms are relevant for their search and integrate different terms

If metadata is bad quality, it undermines its three main purposes to increase discovery, understanding and (re)usability of data.

In order to avoid these drawbacks, we should make sure metadata is high-quality and follows best practice. But what is best practice and how can we implement it?

---

## Best practice in metadata 

To help us overcome these issues and make sure metadata is effective, best practice principles and tools have been established.

**Best practice principles** <p></p>
Best practice principles for metadata creation include:
- Consistency so metadata reliably describes data and can be compared across datasets
- Accurate description so data is easily understood
- Searchability of metadata so data is discoverable
- Persistent use of terms that don't expire

**Tools to implement best practice** <p></p>
Two main tools that are used implement metadata creation best practice are:

    1. Controlled vocabularies  
    2. Metadata schemas and standards

In this unit, we will look at controlled vocabularies and the related concepts of taxonomies and ontologies.

In the [next unit (2.5)](<Unit 2.6 Metadata standards.md>), we will look at metadata schemas and standards.

## What are controlled vocabularies?

'A controlled vocabulary is a list of terms that describes a certain domain of knowledge. In the controlled vocabulary you **only use one term to describe one particular phenomenon**, excluding all other synonyms.'*

Controlled vocabularies are a type of community based standard. They are created, maintained, and updated by communities or organisations in different disciplines. The power of a controlled vocabulary increases when it becomes widely adopted. If you're currently working on a research project, look out for what controlled vocabularies your discipline community recommends.

They provide consistency and structure to metadata, reducing the risk of duplicate terms where different terms are used for the same concept or one term is used for multiple concepts.

For example, a country could be referred to in different ways ...
- America, United States, US
Or in different languages ...
- Germany, Deutschland, Allemagne

The controlled vocabulary, 'ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 Country Codes', offers a list of two-letter codes for every country which can be used across languages, allowing us to standardise how we refer to countries across different research projects 
- US – United States
- DE – Germany

>[!NOTE]
> Currently using NBI Sweden definition of controlled vocabulary (*https://nbisweden.github.io/module-metadata-dm-practices/guide/index.html). I think it gives a bit more depth than the CODATA definition which is this 'List of standardised terminology, words, or phrases, used for indexing or content analysis and information retrieval, usually in a defined information domain.'<br>
> For consistency, should I change it the CODATA definition or keep with NBI Sweden?

## Using a controlled vocabulary 

There are different controlled vocabularies for different concepts.

Here is some metadata for a list of books. What columns do you think could benefit from using a controlled vocabulary? Why?

| Book title             | Author                | Original language  | Language  | Genre    | Quantity
|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------|----------|----------
| To Kill A Mockingbird  | Harper Lee            |  English           | eng       | Fiction | 14                 
| On Social Contract     | Rousseau, Jean-Jacques|  french            | english   | Political non-fiction  | 5           
| The Odyessy            | Homer                 |  Ancient Greek     | Greek     | Poetry fiction | 9      
| Lord Of The Flies      | Golding, W.           |  English           | en        | Coming-of-age literature | 7    

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Should this say "...for different disciplines"?<br>
>:large_blue_diamond: KR I did actually mean concepts as there are CVs that are used across discplines that relate to a particular concept. Should I say disciplines and concepts? Or do you feel that disciplines capture the notion of concepts?

## Where can we use a controlled vocabulary 

We could apply a controlled vocabulary to the Original language, Language, and Genre columns. This is because they will use similar or repeated terms that we need to ensure are standardised across our dataset. 

As the book title and author column will contain unique data for each object, a controlled vocabulary is not relevant. However, we do want to standardise how we write this information, for example, surname, first name / firstname surname / firstname initial, surname etc. 

Looking at the data in those columns, what are some of the current issues?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p></p>

- Data is presented in different ways: _English, eng, en_
- Different levels of specficity in data in the genre column: _Fiction_ compared to _Coming-of-age literature_ and similar terms _Fiction_ and _Literature_ are used interchangeably with no further clarification

Controlled vocabularies provide a way to standardise these terms. The definitions for the terms have been widely agreed in a discipline and can save you time by referring directly to them rather than defining them yourself in your own documentation.
</details>

>[!NOTE]
> Is that correct re the author column? In that you would follow a standard to format that information.
> BO - Yes "author" is a metadata element in different standards (including DDI and Dublin Core).

## Applying a controlled vocabulary 

Going back to our list of books example, we could use the following controlled vocabularies for the Language and Genre metadata fields.

-  A widely adopted cross-disciplinary controlled vocabulary for language names is the [ISO 639-1/639-3](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-3/php/code_list.php](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data)
  - ISO 639-1/639-3 specifies how to write languages in three letter codes e.g. English = eng, French = fra, Ancient Greek = grc, Modern Greek = ell

- A domain-specific controlled vocabulary for labelling genres in library archiving is the [Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials](https://www.loc.gov/aba/publications/FreeLCGFT/freelcgft.html)


| Book title             | Author                | Original language  | Language  | Genre    | Quantity
|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------|----------|----------
| To Kill A Mockingbird  | Harper Lee            |  eng               | eng       | Legal fiction; Domestic fiction; Bildungsromans | 14                 
| On Social Contract     | Jean-Jacques Rousseau |  fra               | eng       | Political literature; Philosophical literature  | 5           
| The Odyessy            | Homer                 |  grc               | ell       | Epic poetry; Mythological fiction; Adventure fiction  | 9      
| Lord Of The Flies      | William Golding       |  eng               | eng       | Allegories; Psychological fiction; Adventure fiction | 7  


>[!NOTE]
> Is there someone we could check with to ask if Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms would be a common vocabulary to use?

## Using a controlled vocabulary: research metadata

Let's think about common controlled vocabulary we may need to use for research projects.

**Cross discipline**
In metadata for research projects we might refer to...
- Countries
  - To describe where the research was conducted
- Organisations
  - To describe who conducted or funded the research


<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p></p>
DDI
  
</details>

**Discipline specific** 
We might also include discipline specific information such as...
- Specialised terms and/or categories
- Keywords or themes specific to our discipline
- Standardised scales or assessments used in a particular field

## Finding a controlled vocabulary

Now that we've identified the columns we can apply controlled vocabularies to, we now need to find a relevant controlled vocabulary.

Your research area or academic discipline may use and encourage certain controlled vocabularies. For example, if you had oceanographic data in the UK, you may want to use the [Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Vocabulary Server](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/) which lists all relevant controlled vocabularies for that field.

If you are storing your data in a repository or using a metadata standard, they may specify certain controlled vocabularies to use (note, we will cover metadata standards in [unit 2.5](<2.5 Metadata standards.md>)).

You can also find controlled vocabularies yourself, using websites such as [Bartoc](https://bartoc.org/) which compiles many controlled vocabularies allowing you to search and filter different across disciplines and concepts to identify the most appropriate one for your data.

Try using [Bartoc](https://bartoc.org/) to find a controlled vocabulary that is relevant for your area of research.

When choosing a controlled vocabulary you should consider...


>[!NOTE]
> Would it be useful here to include a practice example where we give a small set of metadata alongside a short explanation of what the research is about. We then ask participants to find a relevant controlled vocabulary using the Bartoc tool. <p></p>
> BO - Yes, I assumed with it being a case study that's what we'd do :)

## Case study practice: Using a controlled vocabularly 

>[!NOTE]
> Building on the exercise above, ask participants to apply the controlled vocabulary to the metadata.


<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p></p>
Again we would provide the answer to the above in a drop down field.

## Controlled vocabularies: going further

If you work with controlled vocabularies, you may also come across theasuri, taxonomies and ontologies. While these lists have a similar purpose to standardise metadata, they have slightly different features to controlled vocabularies.

Where controlled vocabularies offer one term is used to describe one concept, theasuri offer different terms that are commonly used for the same concept. They may specify what the preferred term to use. 

While controlled lists are a flat list that do not specify relationships between terms, taxonomies and ontologies describe the different connections between terms. This includes the hierarchy of terms, for example a term that has a group of sub-terms related to it (parent/child term). 

The image below describes how the strength of semantics relate to different systems.

Strong semantics refer to systems that are more speific and complex in describing terms and the relationships to each other.

>[!NOTE]
> BO - Is this and the following needed given that it's an introduction course? <br>
> :large_orange_diamond: KR I think it should be included here as on Bartoc's website / other CVs repository websites, Theasuri, taxonomies and ontologies are stored. So if we include the exercise where participants go and look for a relevant CV, I think we should cover these terms. Though can be high-level. However, happy to remove if we think it's too complex for this course. Can discuss on July 23rd team meeting.

## Theasuri 

Instead of providing a singular term, thesauri specifics a preferred term alongside variant terms, broader terms and narrower terms. They can also contain related terms that describe similar concepts.

Terms for art, architecture, decorative arts, material culture, and archival materials: Getty Institute Art and Architecture Thesaurus Online (AAT) 

UNESCO Thesaurus is the list of terms used in education, culture, natural sciences, social sciences, human sciences, communication and information.

## Classifications

Example 1:

- [Give example of a metadata element using ICD]

- Disease and health conditions: International Classification of Disease (ICD)
  - International standard to specifing terms to describe diseases and health conditions for clinical  and research purposes 

>[!NOTE]
> Add information about classifcation

---

## Taxonomies

Taxonomies not only describe specific terms but also define hierarchical structures between different terms, outlining parent/child relationships.

_Give an example of taxonomies_

>[!NOTE]
> COADATA does not have texonomy
>
---

## Ontologies

Shared and standardised list of words, terms and phrases to describe components of a particular discipline or domain, along with a taxonomy of their relations. Compare this to a controlled vocabularies, which tend not to include a structure of relations between their terms. Ontologies are typically developed by domain-specific institutions or communities to aid in the precise referencing of elements. - CODATA

- Ontology further specifies the relationships between different terms

  _Give an example of ontology_

>[!NOTE]
> Ontology isn't bound by hierarchy - have a set of relationships that is explicitly declared
>Something is 'a part of something', something is 'equivalent to'
>More sophisticated way to describe relations between item
