## Unit 1.0

>[!NOTE]
>Need to review case study example. Should we just have independent examples in each unit OR do something like below where there is a narrative and we use the same fictional example to base the practice activities on?

**Case study example**

Congratulations! You’re the newest member of a longitudinal research team at University College London.

The research is funded by UK Department for Young people and the Economic and Social Research Council. The research is looking into the impacts of social media on young people in England.

They have already completed two waves of data collection, collecting data from 437 participants aged 11-16 years old using questionnaires. Wave 1 was completed in 2021 and Wave 2 was completed in 2023. 

You will conduct the next wave of data collection in two months time.

## Unit 1.2

To be added back in when we go through with train the trainer materials.

:mortar_board: Trainer: give 5-10 minutes for people to discuss what common examples of bad data management is before moving on. Invite people to share their ideas with the group.

## Unit 1.3

## Old content

- Helps demonstrate the impact of research when people re-use and cite your dataset, so you get credit for all your outputs
- Scientific journals and funders now require scientists to share data
- Increases your visibility as a researcher
- Improves the quality of your data and accuracy of your research results
- Provides proof of transparent and valid conduct
- Improves our confidence in data and research

## Unit 2.1

**Defining metadata terms**
You may have come across metadata before, or this may be your first time. As such, you might be coming across new terms or revisiting knowledge of metadata concepts.

**Old Table**

|          | N662   | N545  | N1171  | N2REGION | N1112  | N1261 |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|----------|--------|-------
|          | N662   | N545  | N1171  | N2REGION | N1112  | N1261 |
| 1        | 2      |  4    | 6      | -2       | 1      | 1            
| 2        | 1      |  4    | -1     | 1        | 1      | 1        
| 3        | 1      |  4    |  4     | 10       | 1      | 1

**Benefits of strucutre and machine-actionability**

 -  For metadata to be machine readable, it must be structured according to a specific set of rules
    - Standardises the content and structure of documentation, making it easier for computers to extract information from the metadata
    - Tells a computer what something is, how it relates to other things (“objects”), and what to do with it

- Makes data management for researchers easier and more efficient, saving time and imrpvoing accuracy
    - Allows researchers to quickly discover, understand and access data
    - Helps your future self to understand your past research, preserving your data for continued use

- Organise our metadata into useful collections of information. For example, in the previous example, groups of metadata were organised into tabs: Sweep description, Coverage, Funding, Kind of Data, Dataset and Questionnaires.
