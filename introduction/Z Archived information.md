## Unit 1.0

>[!NOTE]
>Need to review case study example. Should we just have independent examples in each unit OR do something like below where there is a narrative and we use the same fictional example to base the practice activities on?

**Case study example**

Congratulations! You’re the newest member of a longitudinal research team at University College London.

The research is funded by UK Department for Young people and the Economic and Social Research Council. The research is looking into the impacts of social media on young people in England.

They have already completed two waves of data collection, collecting data from 437 participants aged 11-16 years old using questionnaires. Wave 1 was completed in 2021 and Wave 2 was completed in 2023. 

You will conduct the next wave of data collection in two months time.

## Unit 1.2

To be added back in when we go through with train the trainer materials.

:mortar_board: Trainer: give 5-10 minutes for people to discuss what common examples of bad data management is before moving on. Invite people to share their ideas with the group.

## Unit 1.3

## Old content

- Helps demonstrate the impact of research when people re-use and cite your dataset, so you get credit for all your outputs
- Scientific journals and funders now require scientists to share data
- Increases your visibility as a researcher
- Improves the quality of your data and accuracy of your research results
- Provides proof of transparent and valid conduct
- Improves our confidence in data and research

## Unit 2.1

**Defining metadata terms**
You may have come across metadata before, or this may be your first time. As such, you might be coming across new terms or revisiting knowledge of metadata concepts.

**Old Table**

|          | N662   | N545  | N1171  | N2REGION | N1112  | N1261 |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|----------|--------|-------
|          | N662   | N545  | N1171  | N2REGION | N1112  | N1261 |
| 1        | 2      |  4    | 6      | -2       | 1      | 1            
| 2        | 1      |  4    | -1     | 1        | 1      | 1        
| 3        | 1      |  4    |  4     | 10       | 1      | 1

**Benefits of strucutre and machine-actionability**

 -  For metadata to be machine readable, it must be structured according to a specific set of rules
    - Standardises the content and structure of documentation, making it easier for computers to extract information from the metadata
    - Tells a computer what something is, how it relates to other things (“objects”), and what to do with it

- Makes data management for researchers easier and more efficient, saving time and imrpvoing accuracy
    - Allows researchers to quickly discover, understand and access data
    - Helps your future self to understand your past research, preserving your data for continued use

- Organise our metadata into useful collections of information. For example, in the previous example, groups of metadata were organised into tabs: Sweep description, Coverage, Funding, Kind of Data, Dataset and Questionnaires.

- Store our data in data repositories
  
- Search data repositories/archives

- Compare studies

**Metadata and FAIR [Written out]**

FINDABLE makes it easier to discover and understand data.
- F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and eternally persistent identifier.
- F2. Data are described with rich metadata.
- F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe
- F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource.

ACCESSIBLE makes it easier to understand how to access the data. 
- A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol (open, free, universally implementable, allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure where necessary)
- A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available
- _Note: data does not need to be open but metadata should be accessible._

INTEROPERABLE allows you to combine datasets for further research.
- I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
- I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
- I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data.

RE-USABLE enables re-use of your own data and re-use for others.
- R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
    - (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
    - (Meta)data are associated with their provenance.
    - (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards.

**Snippets from other trainings**

Below are snippets from other trainings that may be useful to include here. For now they are not included in the main structure in order to avoid repetition.

Benefits of metadata for you as a researcher:
- Increases research efficiency
- Maximises potential of your data, leading to secondary research, data citations and cross study comparison
- Improves data quality and FAIRness

**Finding information about research projects**

Where would you find the answers to these questions? Where would you look? Who would you contact?

**Finding information about research projects**

You may find the information online on sites like data repositories or data catalogues (more information about data respositories and catalogues in unit 2.4). For example:

**Summary**

- Metadata is information that describes data
- Metadata is based on a structure that can be processed by a computer 
- Metadata is important for your future self and others to discover, understand and (re)use data
- Metadata allows researchers to use data effectively because it includes the important information needed to exploit the full potential of data
