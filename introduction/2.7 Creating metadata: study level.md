## How can we go about creating metadata?

In the earlier units, we looked at how we can use metadata in our research processes. In this unit, we will look at how we can go about creating metadata for our own research projects. As we go along, we will refer back to [unit 2.5](<2.5 Controlled vocabularies.md>)  and [unit 2.6](<2.6 Metadata standards.md>) to think about the tools we can use to create high-quality, effective metadata.

We will look at creating metadata to describe a research project as a whole (which is sometimes reffered to as high-level metadata).

## Metadata elements to describe a research project

**Who should create research project metadata?** <p></p>
Every research project should caputre some level of metadata. Even if you're not planning to share or deposit your data, metadata is a helpful tool to help you organise your sources and research, so you can preserve your data and come back to it at a later date. For people who are sharing their data, metadata is an essential tool to help others find, understand and access your data, and is often an essential requirement of data repositories and data catalogues.

**When should you create it?** <p></p>
Creating metadata about your research project can happen from the beinging. Starting your metadata creation at the begining of your research project will save you time in the long-term. Updating and adding to your metadata as you go along will also allow you to record any changes made to the research project, creating provenance and providing transparency around the research process.

**What should you capture?** <p></p>
What metadata elements you capture will depend on what you want to do with your research. If you want to share your research widely, you may need to include more metadata than if you just want to use metadata for your own personal reference only. Also, if you are choosing to deposit your data or metadata into a catalogue or repository, they may specify what metadata elements you need to capture and they can sometimes provide a metadata template or schema to follow.

**Where should you store it?** <p></p>
To begin with, you can create study level metadata in an excel spreadsheet stored alongside your data files. There is also other software available to help create and manage metadata, we will explore this more in the Foundation course.

**What metadata elements might we want to include to describe a research project?** <p></p>

<details>

- Title of study
- Date the data was collected

## How can produce high-quality, effective study-level metadata?

Thinking about to the previous units, what tools can we use to create study level metadata and implement best practice?

**Metadata standards**

<details>
<summary><b>Metadata standards recap</b></summary>
<p></p> 
As we explored in [unit 2.6](2.6 Metadata standards.md>), a metadata schema or standard can help make our metadata interoperable with other projects' metadata. Schemas and standards can also help us identify what metadata to create as they often specifcy what metadata elements to capture. You should select a metadata schema or standard at the very beginning of a reasearch project so you don't have to re-do or retrofit metadata into a standard at the end of a project. 

What schema or standard to use depends on your research. You can select a discipline specific standard or an inter-disciplinary standard. If you want to deposit your data or metadata in a repository, the repository may require you to adhere to a specific schema or standard. 

</details>

For creating metadata about a research project, let's take a look at the metadata standard, [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/about/)

Dublin Core is a commonly used metadata standard used across disciplines. The standard is expressed as a simple schema which contains 15 core elements. While there is no universally agreed set of minimum metadata, Dublin Core is a useful guide for creating metadata for a research project so it can be documented and cited correctly. Depending on your project, some of the metadata elements may not be relevant for your research, so you can adjust what metadata elements to include accordingly.

## Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator

While you can create Dublin Core metadata in an Excel spreadsheet, Dublin Core also provides an online generator where you can input information about your research project and export metadata in a machine-readable file. 

[Dublin Core Simple Generator](https://nsteffel.github.io/dublin_core_generator/generator_nq.html)

Now try creating metadata about your project using the generator.

>[!NOTE]
> Should we provide an example case study to create metadata for? E.g. provide information for a research study which participants can read and then create the metadata for using the generator. We can then provide answers. This may be useful as we can also show how you can create metadata in different ways if you don't use controlled vocabularies. This will then lead to the Advanced generator.
> We can also do an activity for participants to use simple generator for their own research.
> BO - Yes, and if we're making up a case study for the previous unit on CVs, we could use the same one here.

## Benefits of Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator

How does using the Dublin Core schema help our metadata creation?

- Specifies what metadata elements to capture
  - The 15 core elements provide a strong basis of what metadata to create
- Gives definitions of the metadata elements and what sort of data to input into the metadata fields
  - Each metadata element is linked to a new page providing a definition of the metadata element/field
  - For example, for names they recommend to put family name then first name. For dates, they recommend YYYY-MM-DD format
 
>[!NOTE]
> BO - Could move this into the section above when introducing the metadata generator, as I'm not sure it needs to be a section on its own, so you could describe what the generator is and then add this (i.e. why it's helpful, especially for beginners/individuals with limited resources)?

## Challenges of the Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator

What do you think some of the challenges could be around the metadata created by the simple generator?
What tools do you think we could use to enhance metadata best practice?

---
## Challenges Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator: controlled vocabularies

While there are some guidelines as to what to you can put in each metadata field, the simple generator does not refer to controlled vocabularies.

This means metadata can be presented in different ways. This could decrease the quality of your metadata as well as it's interoperability. 

For some input fields, controlled vocabularies may not be necessary. However, othe input fields it may be very useful in ensuring metadata is standardised and clear to understand. What are some of the metadata fields that you think could benefit from using controlled vocabularies?

## Example: unstandardised metadata

- Language:
  - English
  - En

>[!NOTE]
> Provide an example of how the language or location can be presented in different ways

---
## Challenges Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator: undefined metadata elements

While the metadata element definitions go some way to describe sort of data sould be inputted into the metadata field, some elements are open to interpretation.

For example, in the 'Date' element could refer to:
- Date the research was created
- Date the metadata record was created
- Date the data was published
- Date data was submitted
- Date data was last modified

Why is it important that we specify what we are referring to?

## Dublin Core Advanced Metadata Generator

Now explore the [Dublin Core Advanced Metadata Generator](https://nsteffel.github.io/dublin_core_generator/generator.html). 

- What feautres and tools does it include in order to improve the quality of the metadata recorded?
- What's the difference between the Simple Generator and Advanced Generator?
- What tools does the Advanced Generator use that helps create metadata best practice?

---
## Dublin Core Advanced Metadata Generator

For some fields, the Advanced Generator provides a space to further specify the metadata element in order to avoid confusion:

a list of controlled vocabularies that you could use and gives us you the functionality to specify which one you choose.
