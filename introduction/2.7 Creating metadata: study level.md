## How can we go about creating metadata?

In the earlier units, we looked at how we can use metadata in our research processes. In this unit, we will look at how we can go about creating metadata for our own research projects. As we go along, we will refer back to [unit 2.5](<2.5 Controlled vocabularies.md>)  and [unit 2.6](<2.6 Metadata standards.md>) to think about the tools we can use to create high-quality, effective metadata.

We will look at creating metadata to describe a research project as a whole (which is sometimes reffered to as high-level metadata).

## Metadata elements to describe a research project

**Who should create research project metadata?** <p></p>
Every research project should caputre some level of metadata. Even if you're not planning to share or deposit your data, metadata is a helpful tool to help you organise your sources and research, so you can preserve your data and come back to it at a later date. For people who are sharing their data, metadata is an essential tool to help others find, understand and access your data, and is often an essential requirement of data repositories and data catalogues.

**When should you create it?** <p></p>
Creating metadata about your research project can happen from the beinging. Starting your metadata creation at the begining of your research project will save you time in the long-term. Updating and adding to your metadata as you go along will also allow you to record any changes made to the research project, creating provenance and providing transparency around the research process.

**What should you capture?** <p></p>
What metadata elements you capture will depend on what you want to do with your research. If you want to share your research widely, you may need to include more metadata than if you just want to use metadata for your own personal reference only. Also, if you are choosing to deposit your data or metadata into a catalogue or repository, they may specify what metadata elements you need to capture and they can sometimes provide a metadata template or schema to follow.

**Where should you store it?** <p></p>
To begin with, you can create study level metadata in an excel spreadsheet stored alongside your data files. There is also other software available to help create and manage metadata, we will explore this more in the Foundation course.

**What metadata elements might we want to include to describe a research project?** <p></p>

## How can produce high-quality, effective study-level metadata?

Thinking about to the previous units, what tools can we use to create study level metadata and implement best practice?

**Metadata standards**

<details>
<summary><b>Metadata standards recap</b></summary>
<p></p> 
As we explored in [unit 2.6](2.6 Metadata standards.md>), a metadata schema or standard can help make our metadata interoperable with other projects' metadata. Schemas and standards can also help us identify what metadata to create as they often specifcy what metadata elements to capture. You should select a metadata schema or standard at the very beginning of a reasearch project so you don't have to re-do or retrofit metadata into a standard at the end of a project. 

What schema or standard to use depends on your research. You can select a discipline specific standard or an inter-disciplinary standard. If you want to deposit your data or metadata in a repository, the repository may require you to adhere to a specific schema or standard. 

</details>

For creating metadata about a research project, let's take a look at the metadata standard, [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/about/)

Dublin Core is a commonly used metadata standard used across disciplines. The standard is expressed as a simple schema which contains 15 core elements. While there is no universally agreed set of minimum metadata, Dublin Core is a useful guide for creating metadata for a research project so it can be documented and cited correctly. Depending on your project, some of the metadata elements may not be relevant for your research, so you can adjust what metadata elements to include accordingly.

## Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator

While you can create Dublin Core metadata in an Excel spreadsheet, Dublin Core also provides an online generator where you can input information about your research project and export metadata in a machine-readable file. 

[Dublin Core Simple Generator](https://nsteffel.github.io/dublin_core_generator/generator_nq.html)

How does using the Dublin Core schema help our metadata creation?

The generation specifies what metadata elements to capture by outlining 15 core elements. The standard also gives [definitions of the metadata elements](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/usageguide/elements/) and guidance around what data to input into the metadata fields. These definitions are easy to find as each element has a link to the definition page. For example...
- For names they recommend to put family name then first name
- For dates, they recommend YYYY-MM-DD format
- [Explore more here](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/usageguide/elements/)

Using the metadata generator, try creating metadata for the following research project ...

The research project 'Connection to greenspaces in capitals across the UK' conducted by Joe Smith and Mary Jones and looks at the perception of greenspaces of residents in capital cities in the UK. Face-to-face interviews were conducted. It uses It was is published by journals online in 08/09/25 and the research was conducted in September 2022 - June 2023 (London, Cardiff, Edinbrugh, Belfast). The data is stored in English in CSV. The data is open access with CC BY-NC rights.

>[!NOTE]
> **KR TO DO:** Need to complete example above. I have fabricated an example but we can use a real life example if we feel that would work better?
> **KR TO DO:** Show two results from creating metadata from this scenario, show how it captures information slightly differently e.g. in the date column on in the languae colum etc.

## Challenges of the Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator

What do you think some of the challenges could be around the metadata created by the simple generator?

<details>
<summary><b>Challenges of Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator</b></summary>
<p></p>

While there are some guidelines as to what to you can put in each metadata field, the simple generator does not refer to controlled vocabularies.This means metadata can be presented in different ways. This could decrease the quality of your metadata as well as it's interoperability. 

Additionally, while the metadata element definitions go some way to describe sort of data sould be inputted into the metadata field, some elements are open to interpretation.

For example, in the 'Date' element could refer to:
- Date the research was created
- Date the metadata record was created
- Date the data was published
- Date data was submitted
- Date data was last modified

</details>

**How could we improve the quality of this metadata? What tools could we use?**

We could provide more specific metadata element title or definitions so we know what type of data they include for example, we could change 'Date' for 'Date Published'

For some metadata elements, controlled vocabularies can help ensure metadata is standardised and clear to understand. 

What are some of the metadata elements in the Dublin Core Generator that could benefit from using controlled vocabularies?

<summary><b>Metadata elements for that could use CV</b></summary>

- Language
- Subject
- Date
- Type
- Format
- Coverage

## Dublin Core Advanced Metadata Generator

Now explore the [Dublin Core Advanced Metadata Generator](https://nsteffel.github.io/dublin_core_generator/generator.html). 

- What feautres and tools does it include in order to improve the quality of the metadata recorded?
- What's the difference between the Simple Generator and Advanced Generator?
- What tools does the Advanced Generator use that helps create metadata best practice?

## Dublin Core Advanced Metadata Generator

For some fields, the Advanced Generator provides a space to further specify the metadata element in order to avoid confusion:
