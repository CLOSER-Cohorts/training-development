## FAIR data principles

An important principle to underpin any data management approach is the FAIR data principles.

---

## What is FAIR?

You might have heard about FAIR before, or this might be the first time you're coming across the principles. 

Here is a short video to give an overview of what FAIR data is in research.

## What is FAIR? [#Overview]

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**e-usable

What can we do to enact these principles?

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - do we want to say "as researchers", if the audience also includes data managers and funders? We could say "What can we do to enact these principles?" and have some examples for researchers and others for data managers? Or if they're the same there's no need to specify**
> KR Great point re different audiences. When referring to 'other researchers' finding data, should I generalise that to 'other people' so to capture that it might be researchers, funders, policy makers etc.

## **F**indable

**Findable**: other people can easily find data manually and by machine.

- What you can do:
  - Link your publications/data 
    - [How to Cite Datasets and Link to Publications DDC Guide](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/cite-datasets)
  - Create a DOI for your data
  - Cite the data that you have used using a DOI
  - Create a Persistent Idenditifier (PID) for yourself
  - Deposit your data in an trusted repository/archive
     - [Where to keep research data - DDC guide](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/where-keep-research-data)
  - **Create rich machine-readable metadata**  :triangular_flag_on_post:

## **A**ccessible

**Accessible**: other people can clearly understand how to access your data. Note, this does not mean data has to be 'open'. Even when data is restricted, rich metadata should be available in order for other people to know what your data is descibing and what data sharing policies are in place. FAIR states data should be _'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'._

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - Suggest changing "external researchers" to "other researchers", so it's not confused with just researchers outside of your organisation.**

- What you can do:
  - Use standardised technology and readily available software for your data
    - The best format for your data depends on the type of data you have collected
  - Provide your data to repositories in their preferred format, this can be found on their webpages
  - **Create rich machine-readable metadata**  :triangular_flag_on_post:
 
>[!NOTE]
>**BO - What is "standardised technology"? Can we give some examples of technologies and software?**

## **I**nteroperable

**Interoperable**: data should be easily integrated and combined with other datasets.

  - What you can do:
    - Ensure your data is clean and your dataset is well structured. Identify and correct any input or formatting errors
    - **Create rich metadata** :triangular_flag_on_post: that complies with relevant metadata standards and schemas
    - Use tools to standardise your data documentation such as controlled vocabularies, classifications, ontologies (these tools will be covered in unit 2.4)
   
>[!NOTE]
>**BO - We haven't covered standards, schemas, vocabs, classifications, or ontologies yet, so can we explain this more or say it will be explained more later on?**

::: notes
 - e.g. Controlled Vocabularies for mode of collection [11]
 - e.g. Survey responses Office for National statistics ethnic group classification [12]
:::

---

## **R**e-usable

**Re-usable**: data should be available for future research, study and processing, for example secondary research and cross-study research.

- **Create rich metadata** :triangular_flag_on_post: to provide context and describe the contents of your data
- Use standardised terms that are used widely in your discipline (more information about standardisation tools in unit 2.4)
- Select a clear data usage and sharing license

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - Same as above re: standardised terms - needs more explanation.**

## Benefits of FAIR for your data

- Maximises the value and usefulness of your data
- Ensures long-term preservation and reusability of your data
- Enables cross-study and secondary research
- Speeds up the progress of research and improves efficiency
- Easier for others to find your data

## The importance of FAIR important for research

The FAIR principles are key in improving the quality and impact of your data.

Instead of letting data sit on hardrive after publication, FAIR enables data to go further. People can find, re-use and cite datasets, increasing the impact a single research project. This allows data to not only serve it's original research purpose, but contribute to other enquiries from research projects to policy briefings. For researchers, their visibility is increased as their data reaches more people and is cited more widely.

Through effective documentation and research data management, FAIR improves the quality of data and the accruacy of research results. It provides proof of transparent and valid conduct, providing people with confidence in data and research. FAIR builds trust, fosters collaboration, and strengthens the credibility of research findings.

These benefits are some of the many reasons FAIR is increasingly requried by funders and scientific journals. 

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - We'll need to make sure the notes have more explanation, as when people read things like "Improves the quality of your data" I think they'll be thinking "How?" or "Why?". I think this applies to any time in this course where we're bullet-point listing the benefits of something**

## FAIR Data assessment list

If you have a dataset, use the [ARDS online FAIR dataset assessment tool](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/fair-data-self-assessment-tool/) to determine how FAIR your data is.

>[!NOTE]
>**Should this activity come later as it references/asks questions about a person's metadata level? Or could do the test now and ask participants to do it again after the course?**
>**BO - I think later to have a better understanding of the questions.**

## FAIR in action

If you are currently working on a dataset, you can practice FAIR now by completing the following tasks ...

- **Findable**
  - You can use [this guide from OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/find-trustworthy-data-repository) to find a trusted repository that is best suited for your data
  - Create a Persistent Idenfitier for yourself with [Orchid ID](https://orcid.org/)
    
- **Accessible**:
  - Using [this guide from UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/format-your-data/recommended-formats/), determine which is the best file format for your data
    
- **Interoperable**
  - Use the open source tools [Open Data Editor]((https://opendataeditor.okfn.org/) or [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) to clean your dataset, making sure errors are identified and corrected and the dataset is structured effectively 

- **R**e-usable 
   - Use [Creative Commons Guidance](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) and their [License chooser tool](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) to find data sharing license best suited for your research

>[!NOTE]
>**Is there an interoperable task that doesn't involve metadata tools directly? We will covering controlled vocabularies later so it may be better to move that activity till later, once the concept has been explained**
> OLD Interpoerable task: Using [BARTOC's controlled vocabularies search tool](https://bartoc.org/), find the controlled vocabulary most relevant for your data
>**BO - I really like this activity but agree it might be better to move it later on after they've been introduced to repos and CVs etc.**

## What recurring feature that helped implement FAIR Principles wasn't covered in the practice tasks? 

Metadata!
- Documenting your data through creating rich metadata is one of the most effective ways of implementing the FAIR principles in your research
- In modules 2 and 3, we will explore what metadata is, when to create it, how to create it and best practice for its use

---

## FAIR unit summary

- **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**e-usable
- Aims to optimise and make reuse of data easier
- Infrastructures are best placed to implement FAIR for the benefit of users
- Data producers and users need to contribute to create FAIR data

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - Do we say the second point before the summary? If not we should, as the summary should include key points from the previous content.**

## Test your knowledge

Fair data is open data? (T/F)

I can make my data FAIR without capturing metadata for my study. (T/F)

>[!NOTE]
>**Add more T/F statements around FAIR datad**
