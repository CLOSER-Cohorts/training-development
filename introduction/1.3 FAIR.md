## FAIR data principles

The FAIR principles outline the features that make data good quality data. FAIR proposes data should be...

- **F**indable
  - Other people can discover your data and data documentation.
- **A**ccessible
  - Your data and data documentation is accessible by other people (as per data permissions). Note, FAIR data does not mean open data.
- **I**nteroperable
  - Your data and data documentation should be easily integrated and combined with other datasets.
- **R**e-usable
   - Your data can be re-used by other people, serving multiple research purposes beyond the original project.

Since being created in 2016, the FAIR data principles have become a core component in research data management and should be considered in any research project.

By setting a standard of good quality data, FAIR provides the guiding principles for research data management across all disciplines.[1] FAIR was created with the aim to improve sharing and re-use of data in research, tackling some of the challenges around research data management that we encountered in [unit 1.2](<1.2 Research data management.md>).

>[!NOTE]
>BO - I moved the "Since being created..." Sentence before "By setting a standard..." as I think it flows better (change back if you disagree!). I think we can remove or edit "FAIR provides the guiding principles for research data management across all disciplines", as it's repetitive of the RDM sentence before it.

**Note, FAIR data does not mean open data.** FAIR suggests data should be _'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'._

You can watch a short video to gain of an overview of FAIR in research.

So, what can we do to enact these principles in our research?

## **F**indable

**Findable**: other people can easily find your data and the documentation around your data and research project.

**What you can do ...**
  - Link to publications and cite datasets in your research outputs with a DOI
    - [How to Cite Datasets and Link to Publications DDC Guide](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/cite-datasets)
  - Deposit your data in an trusted repository or archive
    - [Where to keep research data - DDC guide](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/where-keep-research-data)[^1]
  - By depositing your data on repository or archive, have a DOI for your data so other people can cite your data
  - Create a Persistent Idenditifier (PID) for yourself (e.g. an Orchid ID) so your profile can be linked to your research
  - <mark>**Create rich machine-readable metadata**</mark> (we will cover metadata creation in unit [2.7](<2.7 Creating metadata: study level>) and the Foundation course)

>[!NOTE]
>BO - What do we mean by creating a PID "for yourself"? Like an ORCID ID to link to your research profile? Or for your dataset/research materials? I think we should add an example.
>JJ - I think we should remove bullet 2 & 3 as the only viable route for most people is to use a respository such as Zenodo, FigShare etc to create a PID for you, which is covered in bullet 4

## **A**ccessible

**Accessible**: your data and data documentation are accessible by other people. Note, this does not mean data has to be 'open'. Even when data is restricted, documentation that outlines what your data is descibing and what the data sharing policies are should be available. FAIR states data should be _'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'._

**What you can do...**
  - Use technology and software that is readily available and widely used in your discipline so people are able to access your data easily, if required. The best format for your data will depend on the type of data you have collected.
  - <mark>**Create rich machine-readable metadata**</mark> that outlines how other people can access your data
  - Provide your data to repositories in their preferred format so your data can be found on their webpages and catalogues
 
>[!NOTE]
>**BO - What is "standardised technology"? Can we give some examples of technologies and software?** <p> </p>
> :large_blue_diamond: KR I've expanded on that point to unpack 'standardised technology'. Not sure whether we are able to recommend specific technology/software or if we could recommend a framework/criteria to identify what technology/software is a good one to pick - e.g. latest version of software, look for recommendations from a certain body) <p> </p>
> BO - sounds a lot better! And I like the idea of explaining some of the criteria to help people make those decisions.

## **I**nteroperable

**Interoperable**: data and data documentation should be easily integrated and combined with other datasets and documentation.

**What you can do...**
  - Ensure your data is clean and well structured, identifying and correcting any input or format errors
  - <mark>**Create rich metadata**</mark> that complies with relevant metadata standards and schemas (we will cover metadata standards and schemas in more depth in [unit 2.6](< 2.6 Metadata standards.md>)
  - Use tools to standardise your data documentation such as controlled vocabularies, classifications, ontologies (we will explore these tools  in [unit 2.5](2.5 Controlled vocabularies)
   
---

## **R**e-usable

**Re-usable**: data should be available for future research, study and processing, for example secondary research and cross-study comparison.

**What you can do...**
- <mark>**Create rich metadata**</mark> to provide context and describe the contents of your data
- Use terms that are used widely in your discipline and/or standardised by an academic community in a formal vocabulary (more information about standardisation tools such as controlled vocabularies and metadata stndards in unit 2.4 and unit 2.5)
- Select a clear data usage and sharing license

## The benefits of FAIR

Below are some of the benefits of FAIR data. These benefits are some of the many reasons FAIR is increasingly requried by funders and scientific journals. 

How do you think enables these benefits? Click through the tabs to see suggestions 

**Improves the efficiency and accuracy of the research process**<br>
Creating a clear record of the data you collect as you go, noting down what datasets contain and where they're stored, helps you avoid the risk of losing or duplicating data. If you need to produce reports about your research process, all the information is ready to go and you don't need to hunt down missing datasets. This saves you the challenge of having to document data retrospectively at the end of a project.

**Improves the quality and trustworthiness of research**<br>
By documenting your dataset and research methods, FAIR provides proof of transparent and valid conduct, providing people with confidence in data and research. Having clear and robust documentation builds trust, fosters collaboration, and strengthens the credibility of research findings.

**Maximises the value and usefulness of data**<br>
Adopting FAIR practices, ensures the long-term preservation and use of data. By using standard software and depositing data in trusted repositories, data is securely stored and discoverable for other people. This means data can outlive an individual project and can be used by other projects as secondary data or in a cross-study comparison. Having strong documentation that uses standardised terms further helps others to find, understand and use  data, even if they don't have any contact with the original research team. It’s a bit like leaving a clear, well-labeled recipe behind instead of a messy list of ingredients. For researchers who created the data, their data reaches more people and can be cited more widely, increasing their visibility without adding any further work.

**Saves money, time and resources**<br>
By enabling data to be re-used in secondary research, cross-research comparison and in other outputs such as policy briefings, we enable data to go further and reduce the risk of duplicating research. This saves time, money and resources in conducting separate research projects. It also ensures that data doesn’t just get produced to exist independently, but it's used acrossed the research community.


>[!NOTE]
> KR - Does this repeat the slide before about the Benefits of FAIR? Maybe we could turn this into an exercise so we're not repeating the same benefits<br>
> BO - It doesn't read as repetitive to me as we start with a high-level overview, then practical tips, and then a more detailed explanation of the benefits.

## FAIR and Metadata

What recurring feature in this unit that helped to implement FAIR Principles wasn't covered in the practice tasks? 

<mark>**Metadata**</mark>

Documenting your data through creating rich metadata is one of the most effective ways of implementing the FAIR principles in your research. In [unit 2.1](<2.1 Introduction to metadata>) and [2.3](<2.3 Metadata in data lifecycle>) , we'll explore what metadata is and how it's used in research.
