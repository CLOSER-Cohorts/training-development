## FAIR data principles

The FAIR principles outline the features that make data good quality data. FAIR proposes data should be...

- **F**indable
  - Other people can discover your data or research project by 
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**e-usable

By setting a standard of good quality data, FAIR provides the guiding principles for research data management across all disciplines.[1] FAIR was created with the aim to improve sharing and re-use of data in research, tackling some of the challenges around research data management that we encountered in [unit 1.2](<1.2 Research data management.md>).

Since being created in 2016, the FAIR data principles have become a core component in research data management and should be considered in any research project.

**Note, FAIR data does not mean open data.** FAIR suggests data should be _'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'._

You can watch a short video to gain of an overview of FAIR in research.

## **F**indable

**Findable**: other people can easily find your data manually and by machine.

**What you can do ...**
  - Link publications and data in your research outputs with a DOI
    - [How to Cite Datasets and Link to Publications DDC Guide](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/cite-datasets)
  - Create a DOI for your data so other people can link to your data
  - Create a Persistent Idenditifier (PID) for yourself
  - Deposit your data in an trusted repository or archive
     - [Where to keep research data - DDC guide](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/how-guides/where-keep-research-data)[^1]
  - <mark>**Create rich machine-readable metadata**</mark>

## **A**ccessible

**Accessible**: your data is accessible by other people. Note, this does not mean data has to be 'open'. Even when data is restricted, documentation that outlines what your data is descibing and what data sharing policies should be available. FAIR states data should be _'as open as possible, as closed as necessary'._

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - Suggest changing "external researchers" to "other researchers", so it's not confused with just researchers outside of your organisation.**
> :large_blue_diamond: KR have changed to 'other people' to indicate people outside of the research field might be engaging with their research. Mark as complete?

**What you can do...**
  - Use technology and software that is readily available and widely used in your discipline so people are able to access your data easily, if required. The best format for your data will depend on the type of data you have collected.
  - <mark>**Create rich machine-readable metadata**</mark> that outlines how other people can access your data
  - Provide your data to repositories in their preferred format so your data can be found on their webpages and catalogues
 
>[!NOTE]
>**BO - What is "standardised technology"? Can we give some examples of technologies and software?** <p> </p>
> :large_blue_diamond: KR I've expanded on that point to unpack 'standardised technology'. Not sure whether we are able to recommend specific technology/software or if we could recommend a framework/criteria to identify what technology/software is a good one to pick - e.g. latest version of software, look for recommendations from a certain body)

---

## **I**nteroperable

**Interoperable**: data should be easily integrated and combined with other datasets.

**What you can do...**
  - Ensure your data is clean and well structured, identifying and correcting any input or format errors
  - <mark>**Create rich metadata**</mark> that complies with relevant metadata standards and schemas
  - Use tools to standardise your data documentation such as controlled vocabularies, classifications, ontologies (these tools will be covered in [unit 2.5](2.5 Controlled vocabularies)
   
---

## **R**e-usable

**Re-usable**: data should be available for future research, study and processing, for example secondary research and cross-study research.

**What you can do...**
- <mark>**Create rich metadata**</mark> to provide context and describe the contents of your data
- Use terms that are used widely in your discipline and/or standardised by an academic community in a formal vocabulary (more information about standardisation tools such as controlled vocabularies and metadata stndards in unit 2.4 and unit 2.5)
- Select a clear data usage and sharing license

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - Same as above re: standardised terms - needs more explanation.** <p> </p>
> :large_blue_diamond: KR I've tried reframing, let me know if you feel that reads better.

## The benefits of FAIR

Below are some of the benefits of FAIR data. 

How do you think enables these benefits? Click through the tabs to see suggestions 

**Improves the efficiency and accuracy research process more efficient**<br>
By creating a clear record of the data you collect as you go along, noting down what datasets contain and where they're stored, helps you avoid the risk of losing or duplicating data. If you need to produce reports about your research process, all the information is ready to go and you don't need to hunt down missing datasets. This saves you the challenge of having to document data retrospectively at the end of a project.

**Improves quality and trustworthiness of research**<br>
FAIR provides proof of transparent and valid conduct, providing people with confidence in data and research. FAIR builds trust, fosters collaboration, and strengthens the credibility of research findings.

**Maximises the value and usefulness of data**<br>
Instead of letting data sit on a hardrive after publication, FAIR ensures the long-term preservation of data. By using standard software and depositing data in trusted repositories, data is securely stored and discoverable by other people. This means your data can outlive an individual project and people can find, understand and use your data years after the project finished.

It’s a bit like leaving a clear, well-labeled recipe behind instead of a messy list of ingredients.

This allows data to not only serve it's original research purpose, but contribute to other enquiries from research projects to policy briefings. For researchers, their visibility is increased as their data reaches more people and is cited more widely.

**Enables secondary research and cross-study comparison**<br>
Through standardising the terms we use to describe and structure our data, FAIR helps other researchers make sense of your data so they can form new enquiries. With robust documentation, FAIR allows people to focus on your dataset as a whole or certain sections of it, opening up a range of research possibilities. This enables data to go further and reduces the risk of wasting resources re-doing the same research. FAIR enables us to directly compare different datasets. This increases the visibility of your work and helps ensure your data doesn’t just exist, it gets used.

These benefits are some of the many reasons FAIR is increasingly requried by funders and scientific journals. 

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - We'll need to make sure the notes have more explanation, as when people read things like "Improves the quality of your data" I think they'll be thinking "How?" or "Why?". I think this applies to any time in this course where we're bullet-point listing the benefits of something** <br>
> KR - Parking this here (could be used as a subheader : The FAIR principles are key in improving the quality and impact of your data. <br>
> KR - Does this repeat the slide before about the Benefits of FAIR? Maybe we could turn this into an exercise so we're not repeating the same benefits

If you are currently working on a dataset, you can practice FAIR now by completing the following tasks ...

- **Findable**
  - You can use [this guide from OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/find-trustworthy-data-repository) to find a trusted repository that is best suited for your data
  - Create a Persistent Idenfitier for yourself with [Orchid ID](https://orcid.org/)
    
- **Accessible**:
  - Using [this guide from UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/format-your-data/recommended-formats/), determine which is the best file format for your data
    
- **Interoperable**
  - Use the open source tools [Open Data Editor](https://opendataeditor.okfn.org/) or [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) to clean your dataset, making sure errors are identified and corrected and the dataset is structured effectively 

- **R**e-usable 
   - Use [Creative Commons Guidance](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) and their [License chooser tool](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) to find data sharing license best suited for your research


>**BO - I really like this activity but agree it might be better to move it later on after they've been introduced to repos and CVs etc.**
> :large_blue_diamond: KR have replace interoperable task - do we feel this works better?

## FAIR and Metadata

What recurring feature that helped implement FAIR Principles wasn't covered in the practice tasks? 

<mark>**Metadata**</mark>

Documenting your data through creating rich metadata is one of the most effective ways of implementing the FAIR principles in your research. In [unit 2.1](<2.1 Introduction to metadata>) and [2.3](<2.3 Metadata in data lifecycle>) , we will explore what metadata is and how it is used in research.
