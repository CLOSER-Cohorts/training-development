## Who's this course for?

This course is for anyone who will be engaging with research data as part of their work, for example using, analysing or collecting research data.

This course may be particularly relevant for ...
- Masters and PhD students
- Researchers 
- People working for funding bodies of academic research
- People working in policy areas that use data and academic research in their work

## What level of information do I need to know before starting the course?

You don't have to have any previous knowledge or training in metadata in order to do the Introduction course. As we will cover in the course, we use metadata in many areas of our lives already often without even realising it. So, even if this is the first time hearing the term, you have most likely engaged with metadata already.

You may already know about metadata and have done some training. This course aims to solidify knowledge around key concepts of metadata.

## How do I take the course?

The Introduction course is split into 10 units. These are...
- **1.1 Research data**  _(add time expectation)_
- **1.2 Research data management** _(add time expectation)_
- **1.3 FAIR** _(add time expectation)_
- **2.1 Introduction to metadata** _(add time expectation)_
- **2.3 Metadata in data lifecycle** _(add time expectation)_
- **2.4 Controlled vocabularies** _(add time expectation)_
- **2.5 Metadata standards** _(add time expectation)_
- **2.6 Creating metadata: study level** _(add time expectation)_
- **2.7 Using metadata: discover and understand data** _(add time expectation)_

If this your first time engaging with metadata, we recommend working through the units chronologically so you can build on your understanding.

If you already have a strong understanding of metadata and are already working it in your research practice, you may only want to dip in and out of units to refresh your understanding or address any gaps in your current knowledge.

If you are already working with metadata or have completed training in metadata before, it's important to note that some terms may be used differently by people and/or disciplines. The way some concepts are defined in this course may also be different to how you currently understand them.

So we can give , we'll define key terms and concepts as we go along. You can refer to the definitions in the course glossary.

> Should we include a glossary for the course?
