## What is study level metadata?

Thinking about to 'Metadata in research' unit, what is study level metadata?

What types of metadata would study level metadata include? 

What metadata elements might you include?

---
## Study level metadata elements

Study level metadata often includes descriptive, administrative and technical metadata.

For example, you could include: 

- Title of study
- Date the data was collected
- Creator of the data
- Location of data collected
- Format the data is in

## Who should create study level metadata and when should you create it?

**Everyone should create study level metadata.** Creating study level metadata from the beinging of your research project ill save you time in the long-term. Adding to and updating your study level metadata as you go along will further allow you to document any changes to the study throughout the project.

To begin with, you can create study level metadata in an excel spreadsheet stored alongside your data files.

What metadata elements you capture will depend on what you want to do with your research. If you want to share your research widely then you may need to include more study level information than if you just want to document for your own use and personal reference.

What tools can we use to help create study level metadata and implement best practice?

## Metadata standards

Using a metadata schema or standard can help make our study level metadata interoperable.

Schemas and standards can also help us identify what metadata to create as they often specifcy what metadata elements o capture.

What schema or standard to use depends on your research. You can select a discipline specific standard or an inter-disciplinary standard.

If you want to deposit your data or metadata in a repository, the repository may require you to adhere to a specific schema or standard. It is important to idenitfy this at the begining of your research so you know what information to collect.

## Metadata standards: Dublin Core

Dublin Core is a inter-disciplinary schema that is commonly used in different research projects. While there is no universally agreed minimum metadata standard, DUblin Core is a good place to start for study level metadata.

## Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator

While you can create Dublin Core metadata in an excel spreadsheet yourself, Dublin Core also provide an online generator where you can input your research information and export metadata in a machine-readable file. 

Create study level metadata using [Dublin Core Simple Generator (https://nsteffel.github.io/dublin_core_generator/generator_nq.html)

## Benefits of Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator 

How does using the Dublin Core schema help our metadata creation?

- It provides us definitions of the metadata elements and what sort of data to input into the metadata fields
- It defines what metadata elements to capture

## Challenges Dublin Core Simple Metadata Generator

What do you think some of the challenges could be around the metadata created by the simple generator?
What tools do you think we could use to enhance metadata best practice?
