## Intended learning outcomes 

- Understand what metadata schemas and standards are
- Understand the benefits of using schemas and standards
- Know how to find and choose relevant schemas and standards for metadata

---

## Outline

- Overview of metadata schemas and standards
- How metadata standards benefits our research and promotes FAIR data
- How to find the right metadata standard for your metadata

---

## Metadata schemas and standards

In the last unit, we looked at how controlled vocabularies can help standardise our metadata so it becomes more interoperable and machine-readable.

Similarly, metadata schemas and standards help implement metadata best practice, increasing the quality and utility of metadata.

The terms metadata schemas and standards are often used interchangeably though, while similar, they are different concepts.

## Metadata schemas

Metadata schemas offer a blueprint of the different metadata elements to use to describe your metadata.

> Need to review this definition of schemas.

## Metadata standards

Metadata standards are similar to schemas however, they provide broader guildines around the content and structure of metadata. They can also speciy what controlled vocabularies to use. Metadata schemas can be based on standards, creating a metadata structure for a more specific prupose. 

Metadata standards are a ready-made framework for describing data and related information. Even within a research area, there may be different ways of saying the same thing. A standard provides a common language so there is a shared understanding. 

Metadata standards provids a consistent way to structure your metadata by using predefined fields with valid inputs, enabling sharing and comparing data across studies. While there are a few cross-discipline standards, they are mostly discipline specific. 

Standards can often specify:
- Which metadata elements are required and which are recommended
- Which controlled vocabularies to use
- The input type (e.g. ...) for the metadata element

>[!NOTE]
> Should we provide an example of a metadata schema that is based on a standard?

## Types of metadata standards

Different types of metadata standards:
- General cross-discipline metadata standards, for example:
  - DublinCore
  - DataCite
    
- Discipline specific metadata standards
  - DDI
  - 

>[!NOTE]
> Are dubline core and datacite known as a schema or a standard?

## Benefits of metadata standards

- Improves consistency
- Makes data more FAIR by increasing the quality of the metadata
  - Enables interoperability of metadata
  - By enabling  cross-study comparison and secondary research, metadata standards support data re-usability
- Saves researchers time in metadata creation as set rules have already put in place

## Case study: Cross study research

_[include a cross-study research case study from CLOSER. point out how both use DDI]_

---

## How to find the right metadata standard for your research

You can use metadata standard cataologues to search for the standard most relevant for your research.
These sites include:
- [Metadata standards catalogue](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/subject-index)
- [DDC Metadata standards guideline](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata)

---

## Case study (practice): Finding a metadata standard

Which metadata standard would you choose for this research project?

Using [Metadata standards catalogue](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/subject-index) or the [DDC Metadata standards guideline](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata) identify a relevant metadata standard to use for this research.

_[Description of research project - discipline, area of enquiry]_

>[!NOTE]
> We would then explain what metadata standard we picked for this dataset and give the reasoning behind it (e.g. popular in the discipline, expansive, relevant etc.)

---

## Case study (answer): Finding a metadata standard

This is the metadata standard we chose.

Reasons behind this choice:
- [give the thought process behind choosing that particular metadata standard]

---

## Application: Find a metadata standardy for your research

Now you have practised finding a relevant metadata standard, find a metadata standard for you research.

## Test your knowledge
