## Intended learning outcomes 

- Understand what metadata schemas and standards are
- Understand the benefits of using schemas and standards
- Know how to find and choose relevant schemas and standards for metadata

---

## Outline

- Overview of metadata schemas and standards
- How metadata standards benefits our research and promotes FAIR data
- How to find the right metadata standard for your metadata

---

## Metadata schemas and standards

In the last unit, we looked at how controlled vocabularies can help standardise our metadata so it becomes more interoperable and machine-readable.

Similarly, metadata schemas and standards help implement metadata best practice, increasing the quality and utility of metadata.

The terms metadata schemas and standards are often used interchangeably though, while related, they are different concepts.

---

## Metadata schemas

Metadata schemas offer a blueprint of the different metadata elements to use to describe your metadata.

>[!NOTE]
> Need to review this definition of schemas.
> A way of describing a standard using an established format such as XML, JSON etc.
> Inerpretation of a standard (sometimes), can have independent schema

## Metadata standards

Metadata standards are similar to schemas however, they provide broader guildines around the content and structure of metadata. They can also speciy what controlled vocabularies to use. Metadata schemas can be based on standards, creating a metadata structure for a more specific prupose. 

Metadata standards are a ready-made framework for describing data and related information. Even within a research area, there may be different ways of saying the same thing. A standard provides a common language so there is a shared understanding. 

Metadata standards provids a consistent way to structure your metadata by using predefined fields with valid inputs, enabling sharing and comparing data across studies. While there are a few cross-discipline standards, they are mostly discipline specific. 

Standards can often specify:
- Which metadata elements are required and which are recommended
- Which controlled vocabularies to use
- The input type (e.g. ...) for the metadata element

>[!NOTE]
> Should we provide an example of a metadata schema that is based on a standard?
> INCLUDE: Standard is a set of metadata elements which are commonly agreed within a data community, normally with some governance and organisation to support its maintenance and evolution.

## Types of metadata standards

Different types of metadata standards

- General cross-discipline metadata standards, for example:
  - Dublin Core
  - DataCite
  - PBCore is a standard for describing sound and moving images.
  - schema.org
    
- Discipline specific metadata standards, for example:
  - Data Documentation Initiative (DDI): DDI is an international standard for describing social science datasets which includes a metadata specification, controlled vocabularies, and tools for working with DDI metadata.
  - Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA): CDWA is a standard for the description of art, architecture, and other cultural works.
  - NeXus: NeXus is an international standard for neutron, x-ray, and muon experiment data.

>[!NOTE]
> Dublin Core is a standard expressed as a schema
> Schema is name, label, description and relationship between metadata elements (description and structure)
> Schema is technical description of a standard - it will normally be in XML, JSON
> Schemas separates metadata element information from the actual metadata
> Standard is the whole thing 
> Are dublin core and datacite known as a schema or a standard?
> Metadata schemas provide similar clarification to metadata elements that contolled vocabularies do for metadata fields
> Schemas constrict meaning of metadata element
> **REVIEW** (doesn't necessarily belong here) Exercise - CSV file (name of column), database schema (name of column and data format), SPSS/STATA/SAS file (data, codelist, label of column but doesn't include relationships), DDI file

## Why should we standardise our data?

Anology of three pin plug standard - you can plug any device into electrical socket in the UK 

Imagine a world where we didnt have data standards 

>[!NOTE]
> Standardisation increases efficiency and simplifies workflows
> Economic of scale argument

## Benefits of metadata standards

- Enables the exchange of data between people and organisations (interoperability)
- Ensures machine actionability of metadata
- Makes data more FAIR by increasing the quality of the metadata
  - Promotes interoperability of metadata
  - By enabling cross-study comparison and secondary research, metadata standards support data re-usability
- Saves researchers time in metadata creation as set rules have already put in place

## Case study: Cross study comparison

- [The rise of the obesity epidemic](https://learning.closer.ac.uk/researchcasestudies/the-rise-of-the-obesity-epidemic/)
  - Uses data from five studies:
    - MRC National Survey of Health and Development (1946 British birth cohort)
    - National Child Development Study (1958 British birth cohort)
    - 1970 British Cohort Study
    - Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
    - Millennium Cohort Study

- [Britain’s mobility problem](https://learning.closer.ac.uk/researchcasestudies/britains-mobility-problem/)
  - Uses data from four studies:
    - MRC National Survey of Health and Development (1946 British birth cohort)
    - National Child Development Study (1958 British birth cohort)
    - 1970 British Cohort Study
    - Understanding Society

- [Childhood environment and adult mental well-being](https://learning.closer.ac.uk/researchcasestudies/childhood-environment-and-adult-mental-well-being/)
  - Uses data from three studies:
    - MRC National Survey of Health and Development
    - 1958 National Child Development Study
    - 1970 British Cohort Study

- [The Effect of the Covid 19 Pandemic on Mental Health](https://learning.closer.ac.uk/researchcasestudies/the-effect-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-mental-health/)
  - Uses data from two studies:
    - Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)
    - Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study

## How to find the right metadata standard for your research

You can use metadata standard catalogues to search for the standard most relevant for your research.

These sites include:
- [Metadata standards catalogue](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/subject-index)
- [DDC Metadata standards guideline](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata)

---

## Case study (practice): Finding a metadata standard

Which metadata standard would you choose for this research project?

Using [Metadata standards catalogue](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/subject-index) or the [DDC Metadata standards guideline](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata) identify a relevant metadata standard to use for this research.

_[Description of research project - discipline, area of enquiry]_

>[!NOTE]
> We would then explain what metadata standard we picked for this dataset and give the reasoning behind it (e.g. popular in the discipline, expansive, relevant etc.)

---

## Case study (answer): Finding a metadata standard

This is the metadata standard we chose.

Reasons behind this choice:
- [give the thought process behind choosing that particular metadata standard]

---

## Application: Find a metadata standard for your research

Now you have practised finding a relevant metadata standard, find a metadata standard for you research.

## Test your knowledge
