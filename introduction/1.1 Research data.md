## What is data?

In the Introduction course, we will be looking at how we can manage and document research data. Before we do this, it's important we have a strong understanding of what data is, the characteristics of data and the role of data in research. <p></p>

We use the term data all the time, but what do we actually mean? We constantly engage with data in our everyday lives. Take your weather app for example. <p></p>

What data is available when we check the weather?

<details>
<summary><b>Data on the weather app</b></summary>
<p></p>

<img src="img/weatherdatacircled1.png" alt="Alt Text" width="425" height="900"> 


The app gives us data on weather conditions for a specified time and location, such as...
- Temperature
- Precipitation
- Cloud coverage

</details>

>[!NOTE]
>**Should geography and time be included in this list as data items displayed in this image?** <br>
>**BO - I don't think it's wrong to include it, but you've said the app gives us data on weather conditions so I think it's fine to just list the data related to weather conditions**<br>
>:large_blue_diamond: KR Updated to just circle weather conditions. Wondering, is it too far to circle the imagery in the background of the app? Technically it reflects conditions outside? But maybe that's considered more formatting than data?

## Representation of data

In this weather app example, we gain information about weather conditions in London by interpreting data. However, we are interpreting different types of data to do this.

For example, interpreting data which are ...
  - Numbers e.g. 16*
  - Text e.g. 'Sunny conditions will continue all day.'
  - Symbols e.g. ☀️
  - Date and time e.g. 04/05/2025, 14:00

So data doesn't come in one set format. Instead we can say data has different _representations_ (e.g. numbers, texts, symbols, date/time etc.). By interpreting these representations, we gain meaning from the data.

---

## Generic definition of data

So, how could we go about defining data?

Data has different definitions in different contexts and disciplines.

Wikipedia offers a broad understanding of data as ...<br>
>"...a collection of discrete or continuous *values* that convey *information* describing the *quantity, quality, fact, statistics*, or other basic units of meaning, or sequences of *symbols* that may be further interpreted *formally*"[^1]

Taking a more business focus, IBM defines data as ...<br>
>'...a collection of facts, numbers, words, observations or other useful information. Through data processing and data analysis, organizations transform raw data points into valuable insights that improve decision-making and drive better business outcomes.'[^2]

Looking at data from a research perspective, CODATA conceives data as...<br>
>'Facts, measurements, recordings, records, or observations about the world, collected by researchers, that are yet to be processed/interpreted/analysed. Data may be in any format or medium taking the form of writings, notes, numbers, symbols, text, images, films, video, sound recordings, pictorial reproductions, drawings, designs or other graphical representations, procedural manuals, forms, diagrams, work flow charts, equipment descriptions, data files, data processing algorithms, or statistical records.'[^3]

While each definition has a slightly different focus, a common theme through each of them is that data can be interpreted in order to give someone more information about the topic or object the data is describing.

## Research data

Data relating to a research enquiry or activity is known as **research data**. Research data serves a sepcific purpose in a research enquiry, whereas data generally may not be linked to a research enquiry or activity.

CODATA defines resesarch data as...

> 'Data that are used as primary sources to support technical or scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or artistic activity, and that are used as evidence in the research process and/or are commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and
results. All other digital and non-digital content have the potential of becoming research data. Research data may be experimental data, observational data, operational data, third party data, public sector data, monitoring data, processed data, or repurposed data.
Therefore, while data in research still conveys information (as the previous definition noted), it is in relation to a specific enquiry or activity.'[^4]

So while research data can come in lots of different representations, all research data has the same underlying purpose and characteristcs.
<p></p> 
What are the core characteristics of research data that differentiate it from general information?
<p></p>

<details>
<summary><b>Characteristics of data</b></summary>
<p></p>

Data relates to a **concept** that we want to study and know more about. 
- In the weather app example this could be: 16* &rarr; temperature, London &rarr; geography, 14:00 &rarr; time
<p></p>
Data is **collected, observed or measured** by an individual or an organisation with the intention of finding our more about that particular concept
  - For example a meteorologist or the Met Office will collect data about the weather in different locations and different times

## Unpacking research data

Let's unpack research data further.

Research data can be concieved as the outcome of this data flow ...

  ``` mermaid
  
  flowchart LR
    sitw(Something in the world) --> Rec(Which is recorded)
    Rec --> Rep(Has a representation)

 ```

If the 'representation' is the data we use in research, what could the first two boxes be?
What does something in the world refer to?
What action do we need take to record it?

   ``` mermaid

    flowchart LR
      Q1(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) --> Q2(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
      Q2 --> Rep1(Has a representation)

 ```

>[!NOTE]
>KR is a 'data flow' the best way to describe this?

---

## Data as a research object 

'Something in the world' can be referred to as the **concept** we are intentionally researching.<br>
'Which is recorded' relates to the **measure** we use to record the concept.<br>
We then use a **representation** to record individual cases of the measure. This is our data.<br>

  ``` mermaid
  
  flowchart LR
    sitw(Something in the world) --> Rec(Which is recorded)
    Rec --> Rep(Has a representation)

 ```

  ``` mermaid

  flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> Rep(Has a representation)

  ```

For example, you may want to collect data for a research activity that involves knowing the age of every participant in a study.<br>

What is **the concept** we want to capture? <br>
- Age of person.

What units could we use to **measure** age? <br>
- Years, months, days, minutes, seconds.
- In order for research data to be suitable for analysis, we can only use _one_ unit of measurement for each concept. So, we couldn't write age as 5 years and 4 months as we would be mixing to units of measurement, years and months. Instead, we could write age as 5 years _or_ 64 months, keeping the one-to-one relationship between concept and meausre.
- The way we conduct this measurement will be our data collection method. For example, we may measure age by asking research participants the question 'What is your age?' in a questionnaire. A questionnaire would therefore be our data collection method.

How would would we represent that **data**? 
- Say we chose to measure age in years. We use numbers so we would record this data numerically. The valid range of numbers that would be acceptable would start from 0 (as your age cannot be in minus numbers) to roughly 115, based on average livespan of a person.
- The collection of this data will make up our dataset.

## A person's age as research data

This is how a person's age as research data would be concieved in our concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data flow.

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    aop(Age of person) --> Ye(Years)
    Ye --> yd(0...115)

```

## Weather data 

Now lets go back to [the weather data](#weather-data-...) we looked at at the start of the course. 

Can you fill in the blank research data flow for a piece of data from that screenshot?

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> Rep(Has a representation)

```

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    B1(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) --> B2(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
    B2 --> B3(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

```

<details>
<summary><b>Temperature</b></summary>
<p></p>

One concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data flow you might have captured is the temperature in London.

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    tol(Temperature of London) --> de(Degrees)
    de --> td("-20...45")

```

</details>


<details>
<summary><b>Wind gusts</b></summary>
<p></p>


Or you might have looked at wind gusts.<br>

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    wgl(Wind gusts in London) --> mph(Miles per hour)
    mph --> mphd("0...100")

```

</details>


<details>
<summary><b>Chance of rain</b></summary>
<p></p>

Or chance of rain.<br>

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    cor(Chance of rain in London) --> prc(Percent)
    prc --> prcd("0...100")

```

</details>

As we can see above, depending on what research data you focus will influence what concept you are measuring and determine what the concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data will be.

## Different types of research data 

Let's try another context.

Imagine you are doing research into young people's relationship with social media.<br>
As part of this research, you need to find out how long each research participant spends on social media platform a day. Try creating a concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data flow for this enquiry.<br>

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> Rep(Has a representation)

```

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    B1(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) --> B2(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
    B2 --> B3(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

```

<details>
<summary><b>Concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data flow</b></summary>
<p></p>

One answer could be:

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    tsosm(Time Spent on Social Media) --> min(Minutes)
    min --> d(0...1440)

```

</details>

## Qualitative data example

Or you may be working on qualitative data. For example 

[NEED TO ADD QUALITATIVE DATA EXAMPLE]

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> Rep(Has a representation)

```

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    B1(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) --> B2(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
    B2 --> B3(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

```

<details>
<summary><b>Concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data flow for qualitative data</b></summary>
<p></p>

</details>

## Research data in your work

If you are currently doing research, consider what research data you're collecting.<br>
Trying complete a concept &rarr; measure &rarr; data flow for your research.

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    C(Concept) --> Me(Measure)
    Me --> Rep(Has a representation)

```

``` mermaid

flowchart LR
    B1(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) --> B2(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
    B2 --> B3(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

```
