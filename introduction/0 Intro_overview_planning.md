## Aim and objectives

Objective:

Aim: 

Participants will gain an understanding of what metadata is, why it is important (the benefits of metadata), and the common tools used for implementing best practice

---
## Audience and delivery

Audience:
- Both metadata users and creators
  - Participants: masters/doctoral students, early career researchers, data managers, funders
  - Train the trainers: course tutors, doctoral students, librarian/learning centres

Delivery
- Mode: Remote
  - In first instance, training is developed on github and exported to interactive website with ppt and pdf materials
  - Interactive elements, e.g. links to case studies, worked examples examples, embedded videos and suggestions of activities to complete on own research
  - Features: videos (also make available on youtube), worked group examples (with answers supploed in the course), application to dataset

---
## Resources

Accompanying resources:
- Template dataset (for those who do not use their own)
- Worksheet (?) â€“ summary of activities that the course will include with spaces for their answers
- Takeaway resource: overview booklet that contains a high-level summary of content (to be available for download / made available to participants once they have completed the course). This should include templates which could be useful for their work and list of external tools and resources available on other sites

Training resources: 
- Training slides should also be available 

Participant resource requirements: bring own dataset (specification needs to be set out for dataset), nor prior learning to require
