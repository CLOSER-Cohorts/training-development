## Intended learning outcomes 

- Understand how to use a codebook to understand a dataset
- Understand how to search data repositories (UK Data Service, CESSDA Data catalogue) -- showing how that's possible through metadata

---
## Outline

- 
- Practise searching and filtering with keywords / variables

## Discovering research: catalogue and repositories

Data catalogue and data repositories are sometimes used interchangeably, however they are different tools.

What is the difference between a data respository and a data catalogue?
Can you describe the different features and aims?

Let's start with definition for a data catalogue and a data repository.

UK Data Service describes a data repository as 'a centralised database system that collects, manages, and stores datasets for later use'. They are design for long-term storage of datasets so they can be managed and accessed through the repository. Repositories may use metadata on dataset pagesto give an overview of the research and/or use metadata to enable a filter or search function.

CoData defines a data catalogue as a 'curated collection of metadata records describing datasets and their data elements. Curated and organised using a formal metadata schema appropriate to data and data sets (e.g. ReCollect etc).'. Sometimes a data catalogue is referred to as a metadata repository. Note this is different from a data repository which stores the actual datasets.

The main difference between the two tools is that a data repository will store the actual data whereas a catalogue will store the metadata records only. Commonly, data repositories and data catalogues will specify what metadata they require through a schema (often based on a relevant metadata standard).

>[!NOTE]
> Is it important to define between the two? If so, is the above differentiation correct?
> Maybe we could show the same study shown in the UK Data Service and CLOSER to show the differences in the information they procide?

## Understanding research: Codebook and data dictionary 

Codebooks and data dictionaries are sometimes used interchangeably however they are different tools.

UK Data Service defines a Codebook as a document that 'describes the contents, structure, and layout of a data collection. Codebooks begin with basic front matter, including the study title, name of the principal investigator(s), table of contents, and an introduction describing the purpose and format of the codebook. Some codebooks also include methodological details, such as how weights were computed, and data collection instruments, while others, especially with larger or more complex data collections, leave those details for a separate user guide and/or data collection instrument.'

CoData defines Data dictionary as a 'collection of descriptions of the data objects or items in a data model. After each data object or item is given a descriptive name, its relationship is described (or it becomes part of some structure that implicitly describes relationship), the type of data (such as text or image or binary value) is described, possible predefined values are listed, and a brief textual description is provided. This collection can be organised for reference into a data dictionary.'

_[ADD A CLEAR LINE ABOUT THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO]_

>[!NOTE]
> Is it necessary to differentiate between Codebook and Data Dictionary in this course? If so, what is the difference we would like to identify? The terms are used interchangeably by many orgs so would be good to get a clear understanding of this as I'm struggling
