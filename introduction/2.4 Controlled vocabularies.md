## Metadata as a search tool

Metadata can be leveraged as a search tool, allowing people to find resources based on keywords. Metadata terms can also be used filters to explore a large set of data or objects. 

We use metadata all the time in our everday life to do this. For example, on shopping sites, the filters we use to find the product we're after are metadata that have been used to described the product. This metadata has been leveraged as a search tools, either returning relevant products when someone searches a term, or allowing people to use them as filters.

---

## Metadata management and best practice

In order to make sure metadata is machine actionable, we need to manage our metadata and follow best practice.

If we don't follow metadata best practice, the value and effectiveness of our metadata is diminished.

However, just because there is metadata does not necessarily make it useful or effective.

For example, the screenshot below shows filters on another online shopping site. Why is this metadata not helpful?

## Bad metadata and discoverability 

Duplicate terms, spelling errors, wrongly placed categories can impact our ability to use metadata usefully as a search and filter function.

## Impact of low quality metadata

Inconsistent and duplicated metadata:
- Hinders the searchability and discoverability of data
- Reduces the reliability and validity of data
- Is time consuming as people have to identify what terms are relevant for their search and integrate different terms

If metadata is bad quality, it undermines its three mains purposes to increase discovery, understanding and (re)susability of data.

---
## Best practice in metadata 

To ensure metadata is effective, best practice in metadata creation needs to be followed.

These best practices should promote:
- Consistency so metadata reliably describes data and can be compared across datasets
- Accuracte description so data is easily understood
- Searchability of metadata so data is discoverable
- Persistent use of terms that don't expire

---
## Tools for metadata best practice

Two main tools that are used implement metadata creation best practice are:

1. Controlled vocabularies
    
2. Metadata schemas and standards

In this unit, we will look at controlled vocabularies and the related concepts of taxonomies and ontologies.

In the next unit (2.5), we will look at metadata schemas and standards.

## What are controlled vocabularies?

'A controlled vocabulary is a list of terms that describes a certain domain of knowledge. In the controlled vocabulary you **only use one term to describe one particular phenomenon**, excluding all other synonyms.'*

The terms in controlled vocabularies can be used in metadata fields. They provide consistency and structure to metadata, reducing the risk of duplicate terms where different terms are used for the same concept or one term is used for multiple concepts.

For example, **XXX**

Controlled vocabularies are a type of community based standard. They are created, maintained and updated by communities or organisations in different disciplines. The power of a controlled vocabulary increases when it becomes widely adopted. If you're currently working on a research project, look out for what controlled vocabularies your discpline community recommends.

>[!NOTE]

## Using a controlled vocabulary 

There are different controlled vocabularies for different concepts.

Here is metadata for a list of books. What columns do you think could benefit from using a controlled vocabulary? Why?

| Book title             | Author                | Original language  | Language  | Genre    | Quantity
|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------|----------|----------
| To Kill A Mockingbird  | Harper Lee            |  English           | eng       | Fiction | 14                 
| On Social Contract     | Rousseau, Jean-Jacques|  french            | english   | Political non-fiction  | 5           
| The Odyessy            | Homer                 |  Ancient Greek     | Greek     | Poetry fiction | 9      
| Lord Of The Flies      | Golding, W.           |  English           | en        | Coming-of-age literature | 7     

---

## Where we can use a controlled vocabulary 

We could apply a controlled vocabulary to Original language, Language and Genre columns. This is because they will use similar or repeated terms that we need to ensure are standardised across our dataset. 

As the book title and author column will contain unique data for each object, a controlled vocabulary is not relevant. However, we do want to standardise how we write this information for example, surname, first name / firstname surname / firstname initial, surname etc. 

Looking at the data in those columns, what are some of the current issues?

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p></p>

- Data is presented in different ways: _English, eng, en_
- Different levels of specficity in data in the genre column: _Fiction_ compared to _Coming-of-age literature_ and similar terms _Fiction_ and _Literature_ are used interchangeably with no further clarification

Controlled vocabularies provide a way to standardise these terms. The definitions for the terms have been widely agreed in a disciplince, and you can save time by referring directly to them rather than define them yourself in your own documentation.
</details>

>[!NOTE]
> Is that correct re the author column? In that you would follow a standard to format that information.

---

## Finding a controlled vocabulary

Now we've identified the columns we can apply controlled vocabularies to, we now need to find a relevant controlled vocabulary.

You can find controlled vocabularies yourself, using websites such as [Bartoc](https://bartoc.org/) which compiles many controlled vocabularies allowing you to search and filter different across many disciplines and concepts in order to identify the most appropriate one for your data.

Similarly, your research area of academic discipline may use and encourage certain controlled vocabularies. For example, if you had oceanographic data in the UK, you may want to use the [Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Vocabulary Server](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/) which lists all relevant controlled vocabularies for that feild.

What controlled vocbaularies you use may also be specificed for you. If you are storing your data in a repository or using a metadata standard, they may specify certain controlled vocabularies to use. (note, we will cover metadata standards in the next unit 2.5)

---

## Choosing the right controlled vocabulary for your metadata

Sometimes metadata users will independently decide what controlled vocabularies they use for a particular metadata field. Other times, a metadata standard or schema might specify what controlled vocabulary to use for a specific metadata field. We will look at metadata standards in the next unit.

>[!NOTE]

## Applying a controlled vocabulary 

- A widely adopted controlled vocabulary for language names across disciplines is the [ISO 639-1/639-3](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-3/php/code_list.php](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data)
  - ISO 639-1/639-3 specifies how to write languages in three letter codes e.g. English = eng, French = fra, Ancient Greek = grc, Modern Greek = ell

- A widely used vocabulary in the library archiving field is the [Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms for Library and Archival Materials](https://www.loc.gov/aba/publications/FreeLCGFT/freelcgft.html)


| Book title             | Author                | Original language  | Language  | Genre    | Quantity
|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------|----------|----------
| To Kill A Mockingbird  | Harper Lee            |  eng               | eng       | Legal fiction; Domestic fiction; Bildungsromans | 14                 
| On Social Contract     | Jean-Jacques Rousseau |  fra               | eng       | Political literature; Philosophical literature  | 5           
| The Odyessy            | Homer                 |  grc               | ell       | Epic poetry; Mythological fiction; Adventure fiction  | 9      
| Lord Of The Flies      | William Golding       |  eng               | eng       | Allegories; Psychological fiction; Adventure fiction | 7  


>[!NOTE]
> Is there someone we could check with to ask if Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms would be a common vocabulary to use?

## Using a controlled vocabulary: research metadata

Now let's think about applying a controlled vocabulary to metadata for research data. 

This is metadata for the same variables from the same dataset documented for a social science research project.

What differences are there? 
What challenges might these differences cause?
Why do you think a controlled vocabulary would be helpful?

| Variable name          | Data type             | Measurement unit  | Method of collection | Response format
|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|---------
| Age                    | Numeric               |  Years           | Survey 1              | Discrete
| Gender identity        | F, M, O            | --               | Survey 3                 | Categorical          
| Access to internet at home   | Y/N          |  --              | Survey 1                | Binary     
| Anxiety score         | GAD-7 scale         |  Scale           | Scale                   | Scale score 


| Variable name          | Data type             | Measurement unit  | Method of collection | Response format
|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|---------
| Age                    | Numeric               |  Years           | Questionnaire   | Discrete
| Gender identity        | F, M, O           | --                | Questionnaire   | Categorical          
| Access to internet at home   | Boolean      |  --              | Questionnaire  | Binary     
| Anxiety score         | GAD-7 scale         |  GAD-7           | Standised scale instument  | Scale score

## Case study practice: Finding a controlled vocabulary

Using [Bartoc](https://bartoc.org/), find a controlled vocabulary that is relevant for this metadata.

[Give an overview of the research project and some metadata elements]

>[!NOTE]
> Would it be useful here to include a practice example where we give a small set of metadata alongside a short explanation of what the research is about. We then ask participants to find a relevant controlled vocabulary using the Bartoc tool.

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p></p>

This is the controlled vocabulary we chose.

Here are the reasons behind this choice:
- [Give the thought process behind choosing that particular controlled vocabulary]

</details>

>[!NOTE]
> We would then explain what controlled vocabulary we picked for this dataset and give the reasoning behind it (e.g. popular in the discipline, expansive, relevant etc.) -- this is in the answers tab

## Case study practice: Using a controlled vocabularly 

>[!NOTE]
> Building on the exercise above, ask participants to apply the controlled vocabulary to the metadata.

## Application: Find a controlled vocabulary for your research

Now you have practised finding a relevant controlled vocabulary, find a controlled vocabulary for your research.

---

## Controlled vocabularies: going further

Some controlled vocabularies are more specific and not only define concept terms but also outline the relationship between different terms and/or concepts.

Theasuri, taxonomies and ontologies are specific types of controlled vocabularies that contian more detailed explanation of terms. 

The image below describes how the strength of semantics relate to different systems.

Strong semantics refer to systems that are more speific and complex in describing terms and the relationships to each other.  

<img src="img/CoData-CVs-flow.png" alt="Alt Text" width="550" height="250">

>[!NOTE]
> Would you describe theasuri (no), taxonomies and ontologies as a type of controlled vocabylary or a separate systems all together?
>Controlled vocabulary is a flat list of terms 

---

## Theasuri 

Instead of providing a singular term, thesauri specifics a preferred term alongside variant terms, broader terms and narrower terms. They can also contain related terms that describe similar concepts.

Terms for art, architecture, decorative arts, material culture, and archival materials: Getty Institute Art and Architecture Thesaurus Online (AAT) 

UNESCO Thesaurus is the list of terms used in education, culture, natural sciences, social sciences, human sciences, communication and information.

## Classifications

Example 1:

- [Give example of a metadata element using ICD]

- Disease and health conditions: International Classification of Disease (ICD)
  - International standard to specifing terms to describe diseases and health conditions for clinical  and research purposes 

>[!NOTE]
> Add information about classifcation

---

## Taxonomies

Taxonomies not only describe specific terms but also define hierarchical structures between different terms, outlining parent/child relationships.

_Give an example of taxonomies_

>[!NOTE]
> Hierarchial only
---

## Ontologies

- Ontology further specifies the relationships between different terms

  _Give an example of ontology_

>[!NOTE]
> Ontology isn't bound by hierarchy - have a set of relationships that is explicitly declared
>Something is 'a part of something', something is 'equivalent to'
>More sophisticated way to describe relations between item
