## Metadata standards and schemas

Even within a research area, there may be different ways of saying the same thing. In the last [unit 2.5](<unit 2.5 Controlled vocabularies.md>), we looked at how controlled vocabularies can help standardise the terms used in our metadata so it becomes more interoperable and machine readable.

While controlled vocabularies standardises the content of the metadata (what's allowed to be inputted into the metadata fields), metadata schemas and standards offer a broader framework around how to structure and definition of metadata elements.

Metadata standards and schemas help us further implement metadata best practice, increasing the consistency, quality and utility of metadata. They provide a common language so that there is a shared understanding of how data and related information is described. Standardising metadata in this way enables sharing and comparing of data across studies, supporting the FAIR data primciples.

Although the terms metadata schemas and standards are often used interchangeably, they are different. But how?

## Metadata standards

Metadata standards provide broad guildines around the content and structure of metadata. They act as a ready-made framework that predefine metadata elements and valid inputs, and they can also specify what controlled vocabularies to use. 

Metadata standards define a large range of elements that may be relevant to a specific field or resource. It is then up to the individual or organisation to use this standard to identify what metadata elements to capture. 

Metadata standards are created and maintained by a particular knowledge or data community. There is usually some form of governance or organisation around a standard so they can be actively reviewed, allowing the standard to grow and evolve in response to the community who will be using it. While there are a few cross-discipline standards, they are mostly discipline specific. 

Standards can often specify:
- Which metadata elements are required and which are recommended
- Which controlled vocabularies to use
- The input type (e.g. ...) for the metadata element

## Metadata schemas

Metadata schemas are a related concept to metadata standards and are similarly a blueprint for describing your data. They are similar to metadata standards in that they specify what metadata elements to use and valid inputs, and they can also specify what controlled vocabularies to use. 

Organisations or an individual may create a schema for personal, internal or public use. A schema can be based on a metadata standard, drawing from the structure and definitions outlined in the standard to inform it's structure and content. In this way, schemas can be seen as an expression of a standard. Whereas standards offer far reaching guidelines, schemas serve a narrower purpose outlining a more specific structure within the perameters of a standard. For example, a data repository or catalogue may provide a schema to follow in order to submit your data to their site. You can also get schemas which have been developed independent of a metadata standard.

For example:
- An individual may create their own metadata schema for a particular project
- An individual may use a publicly available schema to create metadata for their porject
- An organisation may have an internal schema so anyone documenting information about a resource will capture the same metadata elements
- A public repository may have a schema and require anyone wishing to deposit their data to use their schema

## Types of metadata standards

There are metadata standards which are domain agnostic and can be used across disciplines. 

**Examples of domain agnostic, cross-discipline metadata standards...**
  - [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/) is a standard to describe digital resources in order to help discovery 
    - Dublin Core is commonly expressed directly as a [schema](https://www.dublincore.org/schemas/) which are based on the Dublin Core standard
  - [DataCite](https://datacite.org/what-we-do/)
    - Like Dublin Core, DataCite is commonly expressed directly as a [schema](https://schema.datacite.org/) that is updated and based on the DataCite standard
  - [PBCore](https://pbcore.org/) is a standard for describing sound and moving images
    - PBCore publish the latest schema based on their standard on [their website here](https://pbcore.org/xsd)
  - [schema.org](https://schema.org/) is a standard used to describe webpages and other online resources
    - Schema.org shares [commonly used schemas](https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) that are based on the metadata standard

There are also metadata standards which serve specific disciplines and research areas. 
 
**Examples of discipline specific metadata standards...**
  - [Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)](https://ddialliance.org/) is an international standard for describing social science data which includes a metadata specification, controlled vocabularies, and tools for working with DDI metadata
  - [SDMX](https://sdmx.org/) to standardise metadata for statistical data 
  - [NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/) is an international standard for neutron, x-ray, and muon experiment data

## Benefits of metadata standards

Through standardising metadata structure and terminology, metadata standards enable the exchange of metadata between people and organisations (interoperability). It also saves you time when creating metadata as the structure and controlled inputs are already specified. That means you don't have to create a documentation system yourself.

Data repositories and data catalogues specify what metadata standards and schemas to use as it enables them to organise metadata across a vast range of resources coherently. These sites are dependent on this standardisation in order to make metadata machine actionable. This is what enables people using data respositories and catalogues to search and filter (as we explore in [unit 2.4](2.4 Using metadata: Discover data)). This increased exchange improves the discoverability of research (Finable) and encourages cross-study comparison and secondary research (re-usability).

For example, have a look at these cross-study comparisons below. One of the reasons that researchers are able to conduct this work is because all of these studies use the same metadata standards. This not only makes those studies discoverable in the same data catalogue, it allows researchers to easily compare different areas of the study so they can draw new findings and conclusions.

In these examples, the studies use the DDI standard and are discoverable on the [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/find-data/browse/) and [CLOSER Discovery](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/).

- [The rise of the obesity epidemic](https://learning.closer.ac.uk/researchcasestudies/the-rise-of-the-obesity-epidemic/)
  - Uses data from five studies:
    - MRC National Survey of Health and Development (1946 British birth cohort)
    - National Child Development Study (1958 British birth cohort)
    - 1970 British Cohort Study
    - Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
    - Millennium Cohort Study

- [Childhood environment and adult mental well-being](https://learning.closer.ac.uk/researchcasestudies/childhood-environment-and-adult-mental-well-being/)
  - Uses data from three studies:
    - MRC National Survey of Health and Development
    - 1958 National Child Development Study
    - 1970 British Cohort Study

## How to find the right metadata standard for your research

So now we know what metadata standards are, and how they can enable our (meta)data to be interoperable and reusable, but how can you find the right standard for your research?

**Finding a metadata standard**
Metadata standard catalogues sites compiles metadata standards across disciplines and allows you to search for the standard most relevant to your research.

These sites include...
- [Metadata standards catalogue](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/subject-index)
- [DDC Metadata standards guideline](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata)

**Things to consider when choosing a metadata standard ...**
- Uptake of the metadata standard in your field
- Ability of the metadata standard to meet your needs and aims, or the ability to add to a
- How regularly a metadata standard is reviewed and updated by a community

**Why is it important to take time in finding the best metadata standard for your research?**

As mentioned earlier in this unit, the power of a metadata standard increases when it is used more widely. The aim is to have one leading standard for a particular area, allowing us to simplify workflows, increase interoperability and avoid confusion. Therefore, as more people apply the standard, more data becomes interoperable and allows researchers to work from the same structure. If you do not identify which is the best metadata standard for your research, your data may be less interoperable limiting people's ability to find your research and conduct cross-study comparison. 

If you feel the existing leading metadata standard in your research field does not meet your needs and/or are limited in their reach, you should still consider working with the structure of existing metadata standards and adapting it where necessary rather than creating new standards and moving away from the aim of simplifying workflows.

> Should we include the analogy below in this unit or do we feel the above information works ok? 

## Why should we standardise our data?

Imagine you had a phone charger which had the plug below. Say you wanted to plug it into socket at a train station in Leeds, do you think it would work?

_[ADD IMAGE OF 3 PIN PLUG]_

With the same electrical plug, do you think it would work if you wanted to charge your phone at a library in Southampton? Or a cafe in Cardiff? Or at your home?

How do we know that the same socket will work in all the different places?

You know you will be able to charge your phone in any location of the UK as all three-pin plugs distributed in the UK follow a manufacturing standard. This standard means all plugs will have the correct dimensions and functionality to work with any UK socket. The details of this standard is set out by an organisation called the International Organization for Standardization in their standard [ISO 4400:1994](https://www.iso.org/standard/20509.html). Through bringing together experts in relevant fields, they develop and distribute the standard.

What would happen if we didn't have this standard?
