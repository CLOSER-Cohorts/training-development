## Intended learning outcome

- Understand what research data managementis
- Be able to explain the reasons and benefits for research data management
- Understand how to implement good research data management

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - In the ILO's and outline, we use a mix of "data management" and "research data management". I think we should be consistent and always use research data management (unless there is a difference and want want to cover both, in which case this needs to be explicit)? We also need to rephrase the ILO's so they're more like objectives e.g. Be able to explain the reasons and benefits of RDM, Understand how to implement a good DMP. I don't think the first one is a ILO - I think it's related to what this content will cover (i.e. part of the outline).**

## Outline
- What is research data management and why is it important? (Discussion and definition)
- What is the impact of bad research data management?
- What are benefits of good research data management and why is it important?

---

## What is data management?

- Now we have covered what research data is, we can look into what we do with it and how.
- What do we mean by research data management?

::: notes

:mortar_board: Trainer: give 5-10 minutes for people to discuss what data management is before revealing the definition. Invite people to share their ideas with the group.

## Research data management definition 

MANTRA defines research data management as:

"Research data management (RDM) is about handling research data effectively and appropriately throughout the life of a research project and beyond. Research data management refers to all aspects of creating, storing, sharing and archiving data and is an essential aspect of conducting responsible research"

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - related to my comment above, is there a difference between data management and research data management? If so, we need to say what the difference is and which one are we focsing on, because currently we are swapping between the two and I'm not sure if they're interchangable or the same thing.**

## Bad data management 

What happens if you don't manage your data well ...

## Bad research data management

Reflecting on the video you've just watched as well as your own experience, what are some examples of bad research data management?

::: notes

:mortar_board: Trainer: give 5-10 minutes for people to discuss what common examples of bad data management is before moving on. Invite people to share their ideas with the group.

:::

## Examples of bad research data management

- Data is not properly cited or linked in publications
- Links to objects/resources are broken
- There is limited information about the data
- Data in unusable or only available in proprietary software
- No information about the data sharing policy or
- Unclear data access process, how long it takes, cost etc.
- Limited context to understand the data

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - Suggest changing "Links to research" to "Links to research objects/resources" and maybe give an example.**

---

## What is the impact of bad research data management?

- Again, refelcting on the video and your own experience, what are the impacts of bad data management on research?

---

## What is the impact of bad data management?

- Research data is in a silo
  - If people don't know your research exists, it could be unnecessarily duplicated by others
  - If your research data is poor quality, you may have to repeat a study
  - If no-one can find your data, then secondary research or cross-study comparison cannot happen, limiting the use of your data
 
>[!NOTE]
>**BO - "Prevents secondary research" is the same as "Data cannot be reused" - you're saying the data can't be (effectively) used again in both. so I'd just keep the last point specific to cross-study research.**
    
- Data gets lost and is less secure
  - If there is no clear data usage or sharing policies data could be misused
  - If data are not stored in a secure location, they could be lost or accessed by people without permission
    
- Time wasted trying to understand data or organise data retrospectively
  - Researchers have to spend longer trying to find data, understand it and organise it into a meaningful structure
    
- Could jeopardise future research funding
  - If your data is inaccessible and poor quality, institutions are less likely to fund future research

*Bad data management causes inefficiency and devalues the quality and usability of your research.*

## How to implement good data management 

- Develop a robust Data Management Plan (DMP) at the begining of your research project
  - DMPs should address the whole data lifecycle, covering how data will be collected, processed, analysed, described, preserved, and shared during the course of a research project and beyond
  - DMPs should be a living document that is updated as new processes are created and refined 
- Implement FAIR data principles (these principles will be unpacked in unit 1.3)
- Create high quality metadata that adheres to relevant standards (metadata standards will be explored in unit 2.5)

>[!NOTE]
>**BO - I like that you've said FAIR will be addressed in the upcoming slides. Could we add a sentence to this effect re: metadata standards after the last bullet point?**

## Benefits of good data management

Good data management improves ...

- Efficiency
  - Saves time and resources by establishing robust documentation, stoarge and preservation processes
  - Reduces the risk of losing data and enhances lifespan of data
  - Reduces the potential for research duplication
  - Improves internal communication and workflows within a project

- Quality and value of your data
  - Enables other researchers to use your research and encourages cross-study research
  - Proof of transparent & valid data
  - Required to obtain funding and/or meet funding bodies' requirements
  - Improves accuracy and security of your data
  - Facilitates re-use of own data

## Who is responsible for implementing research data management 

[Add here role of research data management, including who should create a DMP]

---

## Good data management case study

>[!NOTE]
> E.g. show a study which has good data documentation / management with a strong DMP
> Pick a study whose findings have had an impact on policy/industry as well as been the subject of secondary research and/or cross study research_

## Application: How strong is your data management? 

- Can you answer the following questions about your research?

## Test your knowledge

When in the research process should you create a data management plan?

What stage of the data lifecycle should a data management plan address?

Who should create a data management plan?

Who is responsible for carrying out a data management plan?

>[!NOTE]
>**Should we include a quiz here about RDM/DMPs**
>**BO - I don't know if we have explicity said who's responsibility it is to create and carry out a DMP in these materials? If we have and I've missed it, please ignore! If we haven't, can we add this?**
