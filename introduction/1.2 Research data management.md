## Using research data

In the previous unit we looked at what research data is, in this unit we will look at what we do with it and how.<p></p>

We use research data as evidence to validate research findings. In order to do this, data needs to be collected and analysed. This may be primary data or secondary data.<p></p>

However, if we don't organise and manage our data, we might  ...
- Not understand our own data as datasets are not labelled and abbreviations are not explained
- We lose data as it's not securely saved and labelled
- Datasets contain human errors

If data is unorganised or 'dirty', our ability to analyse our research and produce effective findings is hindered. <p></p>

Badly managed research data doesn't just impact the person who originally creates and uses the data, it also affects other researchers after the project has finished. <p></p>

For example, take a look at this video. It covers a scenario where one researcher would like to find out more about another researcher's project. However, it is not as straightfoward as it seems. What problems arise? <p></p>

[Sam1 Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2zK3sAtr-4)[^2] <p></p>

Reflecting on the video you just watched as well as your own experience, what are some examples of bad research data management of published data?

<details>
<summary><b>Examples of bad research data management</b></summary>
<p></p>

- Data is not properly cited or linked in publications
- Links to objects/resources are broken e.g. when you follow a link in a citation the page no longer exists or cannot be reached
- Limited context to understand the data
   - Limited information about the project such as, when it was conducted, where it was conducted, who collected the data, how and why 
   - Limited information about what the dataset contains such as, what type of data was collected, what abbreviations mean
- No contact details of a person / organisation that you contact with further questions about the data
- Data in unusable or only available in proprietary software
- No information about the data sharing policy
- Unclear data access process that doesn't specify how long it takes or the cost

## What is the impact of bad research data management?

Bad management of data impacts the discovery, understandability and use of research data. Again, refelcting on the video and your own experience, what are the consequences of this? Who does it impact?

<details>
<summary><b>Consequences of bad research data management</b></summary>
<p></p>

**Research data is in a silo**<p></p>
  - If people don't know your research exists, it could be unnecessarily duplicated by others
  - If your research data is poor quality, you or another researcher may have to repeat a study, doubling the time and resources needed to obtain the data
  - If no-one can find your data, then secondary research or cross-study comparison can't happen, limiting the use and reach of your data

**The reach and use of research data is limited**<p></p>
- If people cannot find or understand your data, they will not use it for citations, secondary research or cross-study comparisons
- If data is poorly managed, other people are less likely to trust and use your data in other projects 

**Research data is less secure**<p></p>
  - If there is no clear data usage or sharing policies data could be misused
  - If data is not stored in a secure location, it could be lost or accessed by people without permission
    
**Time is wasted trying to understand data retrospectively**<p></p>
  - People have to spend more time trying to find and organise data into a meaningful structure so it can be understood and used
    
**Access to future research funding could be impacted**<p></p>
  - If your data is inaccessible and poor quality, institutions are less likely to fund future research

*Bad data management causes inefficiency and devalues the quality and usability of your research.*

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Who is impacted by bad research data management</b></summary>
<p></p>

Bad research data management impacts both the data owner as well as other researchers trying to find and understand their data. 

**Data owners**<p></p>
For data owners, if you don't manage your data well, it's hard to remember and keep track of what data was collected for a particular project. This means you can either forget about your data or spend a long time trying to re-organise and re-understand data you've already collected. If it's not managed as you go along, data can be lost and, if you're dealing with sensitive data, not have the proper levels of security. People are also less likely to use and cite your data as it will be harder for them to find and understand, and will lack the transparency to make it a trustworthy resource. Overall, this will reduce the potential of your data in your research field as well as impact your chances for further funding as your project's reach is diminished. 

**Other researchers**<p></p>
For other people engaging with a project that has bad data management, you will have to spend more time and resource to understand what the data is about and whether it's relevant for your research needs. You're also less likely to trust and use data that is managed poorly, as researh processes are not transparent and key information is missing. As such, you may end up missing out on data that could help your project or replicate existing research as you were not able to find and understand the poorly managed research data.

**Research as a whole**<p></p>
If research data is managed well, a single dataset can be used by mutliple researchers to support a variety of research enquiries. This saves time and resources in collecting data. However, if research data is poorly managed, data cannot be easily re-used meaning more time and money will be spent creating similar datasets.

>:large_blue_diamond: KR Which structure should we keep for impacts of bad data management? I think we should only use one as it might get quite repetition. Should we use the role specific one or the thematic one?

## Reseach data management

In order to avoid these problems, research data needs to be managed. This concept is called research data management (RDM).

What do do you think we mean by RDM?

<details>
<summary><b>Research data management definition</b></summary>
<p></p>

MANTRA defines research data management as...

"Research data management (RDM) is about handling research data effectively and appropriately throughout the life of a research project and beyond. Research data management refers to all aspects of creating, storing, sharing and archiving data and is an essential aspect of conducting responsible research"[^1]

## Implementing good research data management 

**So, who's responsible for implementing good research data management?** <p></p>
Everyone involved in a research project is responsible for implementing good research data management. Larger projects may assign different roles and share out RDM responsibilities. People outisde of the research project are also responsible for good RDM when they cite or re-use that data.

**How can we implement good research data management in our own research?** <p></p>

**Data Managment Plan**<br>
Data Management Plans (DMP) are a document that outline how a project will manage their data. This includes assigned roles in research data management, where and how data will be stored and documented. It is advised that all research projects create at DMP at the begining of the project.[^3] Some key features of DMPS are ...
  - DMPs should address the whole data lifecycle, covering how data will be collected, processed, analysed, described, preserved, and shared during the course of a research project and beyond [we will look more closely at the data lifecycle in unit 2.3](<2.3 Metadata in data lifecycle.md>).
  - DMPs should be a living document that is updated as processes are refined and created when the need arises.
  - To find out more about DMPs, explore the resources listed [in this section](##-further-data-management-resources)

**FAIR Data principles**<br>
In order to help guide research data management across all discplines, the FAIR data principles were established as a hallmark of best practice that all projects should aim for. The principles help researchers avoid the common problems that come from bad resarch data management and encourage data to be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable (FAIR). We will unpack these pricniples in the next [unit 1.3](<1.3 FAIR.md>).

**Create structured documentation**<br>
By creating high quality documentation around research data, you can record key information that will help you organise data. For example, recording what different datasets contain and the security levels. You can also share this documentation with other researchers so they can understand your data without having to access to data files first (note, this documentation does not need to contain any sensitive information). Metadata is a type of structured documentation that helps do this. We will cover what metadata is and how it is used in research in [unit 2.1](<2.1 Introduction to metadata.md>)

## Research data management case studies and guidnace

When thinking about how to implement good research data management for your project, it's useful to look at case studies, examples and guidance.

The Digital Curation Centre (DCC) provide case studies of [good research data managment here](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/case-studies) and provides [examples of DMPs alongside guidance here](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans/guidance-examples)

LEARN have create a [Toolkit of Best Practice for Research Data Management](https://learn-rdm.eu/wp-content/uploads/RDMToolkit.pdf), which includes lots of examples of how research data management is implemented.

>[!NOTE]
> Two case studies we could look at more detail together in this unit are: [RDM strategy: moving from plans to action](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/RDM%20strategy%20development.pdf) and [Bringing it all together: a case study on the improvement of Research Data Management at Monash University](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/publications/case-studies/Monash-case-study.pdf)

Exploring these case studies and guidance, what do you think are the benefits of good research data management? How can do you think good research management can help the research process and data quality?

<details>
<summary><b>Benefits of good research data management</b></summary>
<p></p>

**Efficiency**<br>
  - Saves time and resources by establishing robust documentation, stoarge and preservation processes
  - Reduces the risk of losing data and ensures long-term preservation of data
  - Reduces the potential for research duplication
  - Improves internal communication and workflows within a project

**Quality and trustworthiness of your data**<br>
  - Enables other researchers to use your research and encourages cross-study research
  - Proof of transparent & valid data
  - Improves accuracy and security of your data

**Encourages re-use and makes your data go further**<br>
  - Facilitates re-use of data by yourself and others
  - Required to obtain funding and/or meet funding bodies' requirements
