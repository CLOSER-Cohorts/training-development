## What is metadata?

Metadata is a form of data documentation that describes data, giving us the context we need to understand and interpret the data.

---
## Features of metadata

Metadata is a form data documentation that is machine-readable.

By being machine readable, metadata can be:
- Easily searched
- Compared with metadata from other research projects

To be machine readable, metadata needs to be:
- Structured 
- Created and managed in specific formats
  - CSV, XML, SAV, XLS, JSON, RDF, SHP

## How to create metadata

**Manually create metadata**
  - It is possible to create metadata from scratch with the software you have your computer now. You can create an excel spreadsheet documenting your data. When creating metadata manually this way, you will have to determine what metadata elements you want to include as well as ensure the metadata is structured and clean. If you are doing a small one-off project, this may be all you need. However, if you're doing a large project and need to capture extensive information, you may need to look into tools that will help you generate, manage and store your metadata
  

**Tools to create metadata**
  - Online tools:
    - [Dublin Core Generator](https://nsteffel.github.io/dublin_core_generator/index.html)
  - Free open source tools:
    - [Collectica for Excel (standard)](https://www.colectica.com/software/colecticaforexcel/)
    - [Nesstar Publisher](https://www.ihsn.org/software/ddi-metadata-editor)
  - Commercial tools:
    - [Collectica for Excel (advanced packages), questionnaire, designer](https://www.colectica.com/software/)
   
There are a wide range of metadata tools with different fucntionalities, for example: metadata management, quality review, repository compliance checkers, metadata mapping tools. Depending on your needs, you may want to use more than one tool in your metadata management.

You can further explore useful metadata creation tools here: 
- DDC provide a [list of metadata tools you can explore](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata/tools)
- UK Data service provide a [list of tools that can be used to explore and document data](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/exploring-data/uk-data-service-online-tools-for-exploring-data/)

## Storing and managing metadata

Format:
- Metadata needs to be stored in machine-readable formats, for example: CSV, XML, SAV, XLS, JSON, RDF, SHP

Location:
- Metadata can be stored in a spearate file alongside your data
- Metadata can be embedded in the data file
- You may store metadata in one area or have both embedded and separate metadata files. It is important to keep a record of where your metadata is stored so you can easily extract it when necessary

Sharing metadata in other formats:
- You may export your metadata in to other formats such as PDF so you can share information about data with other people. However the original format will be a machine-readable format, that can effectively structured and managed.

## Creating metadata in the foundation unit

In the foundation unit, we will be exploring common metadata elements and terms. While metadata can be created for any research project and data type, we will be focusing on metadata creation for tabular data. If you have tabular dataset you would like to create practice creating metadata for, have it open while completing this unit. If you do not, you can download the practice dataset available with this unit.

If you do not regularly work with tabular data, this course will still cover useful metadata elements and concepts that could help you in your metadata approach.

For training purposes, we will create metadata in an excel file as we go along. However, depending on your research project and the tools you chose to use, you may create metadata in a different way/format.

Excel can be a useful starting point as it allows your to control data input into cells, ensuring your metadata stays structured and standardised.
For example, some useful tools could be:

- Locking cells so metadata element titles can't be changed
- Control data input using data validation and formatting tools
