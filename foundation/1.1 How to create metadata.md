## What is metadata?

Metadata is a form of data documentation that describes data, giving us the context we need to understand and interpret the data.


---
## Features of metadata

Metadata is a form data documentation that is machine-readable/

By being machine readable, metadata can be:
- Easily searched
- [explain benefits - searchable]_

To be machine readable, metadata needs to be:
- Structured 
- Created and managed in specific formats
  - CSV, XML, SAV, XLS, JSON, RDF, SHP

## How to create metadata

- Manually create metadata
  - It is possible to create metadata from scratch with the software you have your computer now. You can create an excel spreadsheet documenting your data. When creating metadata manually this way, you will have to determine what metadata elements you want to include as well as ensure the metadata is structured and clean. If you are doing a small one-off project, this may be all you need. However, if you're doing a large project and need to capture extensive information, you may need to look into tools that will help you generate, manage and store your metadata
  
- Tools to create metadata
  - Online tools:
    - Dublin Core Generator
  - Free open source tools:
    - Collectica for Excel (standard)
  - Paid-for commercial tools:
    - Collectica for Excel (advanced packages), questionnaire, designer
    - SPSS

## Storing and managing metadata

Format:
- Metadata needs to be stored in machine-readable formats, for example: CSV, XML, SAV, XLS, JSON, RDF, SHP

Location:
- Metadata can be stored in a spearate file alongside your data
- Metadata can be embedded in the data file
- You may store metadata in one are or 

Sharing metadata:
- You may export your metadata in to other formats such as PDF so you can share information about data with other people. However the original format will be a machine-readable format, that can effectively structured and managed.

## Creating metadata in this unit

- In the foundation unit, we will be familarising ourselve with common metadata elements and terms.
- For training purposes, we will create metadata in an excel file as we go along. However, depending on your research project and the tools you chose to use, you may create metadata in a different way/format.

Useful excel tools for metadata creation:

- Locking cells
- Define data input
- Format control
