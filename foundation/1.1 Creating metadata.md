## Metadata: a recap

Before we go into metadata creation, let's recap what metadata is.

Try answering the following questions in your own words.

<details>
<summary><b>What is metadata?</b></summary>
<p></p>
Metadata is a form of data documentation that describes data, giving us the context we need to understand data and use it in a meaningful way. It is often referred to as 'data about data'. 
  
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What are the features of metadata that differentiate from other forms of documentation?</b></summary>
<p></p>
Unlike other forms of free-text documentation, metadata is machine readable documentation. To be machine readable, metadata needs to be:
- Structured 
- Created and stored in machine readable formats
  - For example: CSV, XML, SAV, XLS, JSON, RDF, SHP

By being machine readable, metadata is also machine actionable. This means we can search and filter metadata on sites such as data repositories and data catalogues.

## What metadata should you create?

You may be a researcher or student about to conduct research project. How do you know what metadata to create?

There is no singular, universally-agreed set of minimum metadata standards. If you look on the internet, there are a variety of suggestions as to what metadata elements should be captured. Often this is discpline or resource specific.

While the more metadata you create makes your data more discoverable, understandable and (re)usable, the amount of metadata you create can be a trade-off between time and resource.

So, how do we decide what metadata to create?

## How to decide what metadata to create

**Core metadata elements for all research projects**<br>
While there is no one minimum metadata standard, there are core metadata elements that are commonly used across disciplines. This covers the high level metadata about a project; the who, what, where, when and how of the research. 

**Identifying metadata required for your research project**<br>
Beyond this set of core metadata, what metadata you create depends on the scope and aims of your research project.  

To identify what metadata to create, you could consider the following questions ...

**Sharing data...**
- Do you plan to share your data or is it for personal reference only?
- If you will share your data, how many people will you share it with?
- If you're making your data discoverable to others, how widely do you want to share it? (note, this does not mean the data has to be open)
- Will the people who will interact with your (meta)data have direct contact with you and/or your research team?

<details>
<summary><b>Sharing data: metadata considerations</b></summary>
<p></p>

**Personal use**<br>
If you're not planning to share your data, you will be the main user of your metadata. You can choose metadata elements that will help you manage and preserve your data. Creating this metadata will help you conduct your research efficiently as well as help your future self to understand the data you collected. 

**Sharing data**<br>
If you're sharing (meta)data with external people who don't have direct with you, your metadata needs to provide a standalone guide to your research and data. As people won't be able to contact you easily to clarify confusing or missing information, it's important to make sure your metadata is clear, standardised and comprehensive from the get go. This means you will most likely create more metadata than a project that does not share it's (meta)data. Tools such as metadata standards and controlled vocabularies will also be fundamental in ensuring your metadata is interoperable and (re)usable by yourself and others.

</details>

<p></p>
<p></p>

**Size of project...**<br>

- What is the scale of your research?
- How many researchers are working on the project?
- How many people will be creating the metadata?
- What time and resources do you have available?
- What software do you have available to use?

<details>
<summary><b>Size of project: metadata considerations</b></summary>
<p></p>

**Scale**<br>
If you're working on a large research project that handles a vast amount of data, you will need to create more metadata in order to effectively describe the research processes and different types of data the research contains. If it's a small research project, you may not need to include as many metadata elements.

**Research team**<br>
If you are working with a large research team, it is important to establish a clear metadata schema so metadata remains consistent and standardised. This will ensure everyone across the team can understand the project's metadata and contribute to its creation and management. If you are doing a solo research project, you may want to create your own metadata template. However, it can still be useful to follow a metadata schema and use controlled vocabularies in order to make sure your metadata is consistent and high quality.

**Time and resources**<br>
If you are working on a large research project, you may have more time and resource to create metadata. You could use specific metadata tools to help create and manage your metadata. If you are doing a small, solo project, you may not have the capacity to create extensive metadata or the access to metadata tools. In this scenario, it's important to prioritise the high value metadata for your research that support the aims of your project.

</details>

<p></p>
<p></p>

**One-off or repeated study** <br>
- Is it a one-off study or a repeated study?
- If it is a repeated study, have there already been completed studies? What will the upcoming studies cover?

<details>
<summary><b>One-off or repeated study: metadata considerations</b></summary>
<p></p>

**Repeated study**<br>
If you are creating metadata for a repeated study, it is important to consider what metadata was captured for previous studies, including what schemas or standards were used. You should incoporate this metadata structure into the metadata creation for a new project in the series in order to make sure your data is interoperable.

**One-off study**<br>
For a one-off study, you have more felxibility about what metadata you create and/or what schema you use as it only needs to serve the aims of that individual project. However, it is still important to consider how you can make your (meta)data interoperable with other research projects in your field.

</details><p>

**Data repositories and catologues** <br>
- Are you planning to deposit your (meta)data in a data repository and/or data catalogue?

<details>
<summary><b>Data repositories and catologues: metadata considerations</b></summary>
<p></p>

If you're depositing your (meta)data on data catalogues or data repositories, they may specify what metadata standards and controlled vocabularies to use. They may provide guidance or a metadata template/model, for example...
   - [CESSDA Data Model]( https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Resource-crd-2592) maps out the required metadata elements needed to deposit a dataset in their data cataologue
   - [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/deposit-data/prepare-your-data-for-deposit/) gives guidance on how to prepare your metadata and documentation 

</details>

**Discipline standards** 
- What common metadata standards are used in your discipline?

## How to create metadata

**What software should you use to create metadata?**
There's no singular software you should use to create metadata. As long as the software is machine readable, you can use it to create and manage metadata. You may then export your metadata into text based formats such as PDF, in order to create further documentation but the original file will be machine readable.

There are tools and software that are designed specifically to generate, manage and store metadata. These tools can be particularly useful if you're doing a large project and need to capture extensive metadata.

Metadata tools include...

  - Online tools:
    - [Dublin Core Generator](https://nsteffel.github.io/dublin_core_generator/index.html)
  - Free open source tools:
    - [Collectica for Excel (standard)](https://www.colectica.com/software/colecticaforexcel/)
    - [Nesstar Publisher](https://www.ihsn.org/software/ddi-metadata-editor)
  - Commercial tools:
    - [Collectica for Excel (advanced packages), questionnaire, designer](https://www.colectica.com/software/)
   
You can further explore useful metadata tools here ...
- DCC provide a [list of metadata tools you can explore](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata/tools)
- UK Data service provide a [list of tools that can be used to explore and document data](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/exploring-data/uk-data-service-online-tools-for-exploring-data/)

Metadata tools can provide different different fucntionalities, for example: metadata management, quality review, repository compliance checkers, metadata mapping tools. Depending on your needs, you may want to use more than one tool in your metadata management.

You can also simply create metadata in an excel spreadsheet. If you're doing a small one-off project, this may be all you need. In the Foundation course, we will look at creating metadata in excel, using a metadata template to create metadata for a research project. 

**Where to create and store metadata**
Metadata can be stored in different locations. This includes ...
- Metadata can be stored in a spearate file alongside your data
- Metadata can be embedded in the data file

You may store metadata in one area or have both embedded and separate metadata files. It is important to keep a record of where your metadata is stored so you can easily extract it when necessary.

## Creating metadata in the Foundation unit

In the Foundation course, we will explore common metadata elements. While metadata can be created for any research project and data type, we will be focusing on metadata for tabular data. If you have tabular dataset you would like to create metadata for, have it open while completing this course. If you do not, you can download the practice dataset available with this unit.

If you do not regularly work with tabular data, the metadata elements and concepts this course covers are still relevant across disciplines and data types.

For training purposes, we will create metadata in an excel file. However, depending on your research project and the tools you chose to use, you may create metadata in a different way/format.

**Excel for creating metadata**<br>
Excel is an accessible machine readable format. In excel, you can create a table to document your metadata for a research project. You can download the metadata template for the foundation course here XXX

Excel also has useful features that can help ensure your metadata is clean, well structured and standardised. For example, you can lock cells so that metadata element titles can't be changed or you can control what data can be inputted into certain metadata fields using data validation and and formatting tools.

## What metadata should I create?

There are many different ways we could describe data and, as such, there are many different elements we could capture. 

While the more metadata you create makes your data more discoverable, understandable and (re)usable, the amount of metadata you create it is a trade-off between time and resource.

There is no singular, universally-agreed set of minimum metadata standards. If you look on the internet, there are a variety of suggestions as to what should be required as a minimum standard. Often this discpline or resource specific.

So, how do we decide what metadata to create?

---

## Finding what metadata you need to create for your research

**Core metadata elements**
While there is no one minimum metadata standard, there are common metadata elements that are key in research data management. This core metadata captures the high level metadata; the who, what, where, when and how of the research. How you document these metadata may be defined further if you are using a particular metadata standard and/or controlled vocabulary.

**Identifying metadata required for your research project**
Beyond this set of core metadata, what metadata you create depends on your individual project.

To identify what metadata elements to create, you should consider...

**Scope and aim of your research**
  - Is it a one-off study or a repeated study?
  - How many people will you share you data with? Is it an independent project for personal reference or will you make your data discoverable and available to others? If you're making your data discoverable to others, how widely do you want to share it? (note, this does not mean the data has to be open)
  - Do the poeple you are sharing your research with have direct contact with you and/or your research?
    
**Resources and time**
  - What software do you have available to use?
  - How many people will be creating the metadata?
    
**Discipline and research field**
  - What are the common standards and requirements in your discipline?
    
**Repository requirements**
 - If you plan to deposit your research in a repository, they often specify what metadata they require. You can see the requirments for depositing data on the repository website. They can sometimes be called metadata models. For example:
   - [CESSDA Data Model]( https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Resource-crd-2592) maps out the required metadata elements needed to deposit a dataset in their data cataologue
   - [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/deposit-data/prepare-your-data-for-deposit/) gives guidance on how to prepare your metadata and documentation

## Metadata for small research projects

If you're doing a one-off research project for personal use, you will be the main user of your metadata. As you do not need your research to be discoverable by other people, you may not have to create extensive metadata. Instead, you can choose metadata elements that will help you manage and preserve your data. Creating this metadata will help you conduct your research efficiently as well as help your future self to understand the data you collected. Even if the metadata you create is intended only for you, it is important to plan your metadata creation and management and follow best practices.
<p></p>
What challenges might arise if you don't plan your metadata approach and follow best practice?

<details>
<summary><b>Potential challenges in metadata creation</b></summary>
<p></p>

If we don't plan how we will create metadata and follow best practice ...
- Metadata creation can become time consuming
- The metadata we create is confusing and inconsistent, losing meaning or value
- Metadata is unique to this singular project reducing its reusability in other research projects you do in the future or it's interoperability if you decide to share your metadata in the future
- Increase chance of human error

</details>
   
In this unit, we will look at some common metadata elements at study, variable and question level in order to help simplify this process and help identify minimum about of metadata to create. We will also look at how we can apply some of the best practice tools we explored in the Introduction course, such as controlled vocabularies (unit 2.5) and metadata standards (unit 2.6), when creating metadata.

## Metadata for large research projects

If you are working on a large research project that handles a vast amount of data, you will need to create more metadata in order to effectively describe the research processes and different types of data the research contains. 

If you are sharing (meta)data with external people who don't have direct with you, your metadata needs to provide a standalone guide to your research and data. As people won't be able to contact you easily to clarify documentation or missing information, it's important to make sure your metadata is clear, standardised and comprehensive from the get go. Tools such as metadata standards and controlled vocabularies will be fundamental in ensuring your metadata is interoperable and (re)usable by yourself and others.

If you're depositing your (meta)data on data catalogues or data repositories, you will need to ensure that you create all the required metadata elements, following any specified metadata standards and/or controlled vocabularies.

In this course, we will cover a core set of metadata elements that a research project can create. However, for larger research projects you will also have to capture further information.

## Using metadata tools to decide what metadata to create

Using tools such data repositories, data catalogues, schemas and standards can help define what metadata elements to create, saving you time deciding yourslef.


**Data repositories and catalogues**<br>
Even if you're not planning to deposit your data, data catalogues and schemas can be a great place to get initial guidance or advice.

For example, here is some advice on what metadata to create provided by data catalogues ...
- [CESSDA Metadata model](https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Resource-crd-2592) gives a alist of metadata elements marking them mandatory, recommended and optional. It gives a description of each element as well as recommended controlled vocabularies.
- [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/deposit-data/prepare-your-data-for-deposit/) gives guidance on how to prepare your metadata and documentation 

**Metadata schemas and standards**<br>
Metadata schemas and standards are a ready-made framework for describing data and related information. It provides a consistent way to structure your metadata by using predefined fields with valid inputs. This not only saves you time by specifying what metadata to create, it also ensures your metadata is compatible with other metadata using the same standard, enabling sharing and comparing across projects. 

<details>
<summary><b>Using standards / schemas for small research projects</b></summary>
<p></p>
Why use metadata schemas and standards even if you don't plan to share your data?

You may not have the time or need to use a full metadata standard or schema, however using one to inform you metadata creation will provide you with many benefits.

For example ...

**Organising your research:** These tools help you organise your research data in a consistent way. It saves you time deciding what metadata fields to create and what input should be allowed as the standard alreadt specifies this. If you come back to your data in six months or years, clear metadata will help you remember what everything means and how to use it again.

**Clarity and understanding:** When writing a paper about your data, you'll need to explain your data collection methods and results clearly. Using a schema ensures you capture all the necessary details from the start, like how you measured “satisfaction” and what the scale meant.

**Future sharing:** Even if your research isn’t shared now, in the future, you may want to deposit it in a repository. If you use a common metadata standard from the start, the transition to data sharing will be smoother.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Using standards / schemas for for large shared project</b></summary>
<p></p>

If you want to share your (meta)data widely and deposit it in a repository or catalogue, using a metadata schema and standard is essential in ensuring you data is interoperable. Moreover, if you're working on larger project alongside multiple researchers, schemas and standards are great way to standardise the language you use internally, reducing the risk of confusion and miscommnuication.

**Collaboration:** in larger research projects there will often be multiple people working with a dataset and managing/creating metadata. Metadata standards aids this collaborative working environment, ensuring you are using the same definitions and valid inputs for metadata elements and fields. This ensures your metadata is clean and high quality.

**Sharing your (meta)data:**

**Interoperability:** Standards also make your metadata interoperable, meaning it is easier to exchange, process, and compare information across systems and tools. The more people who adopt a standard, the more powerful and effective it becomes.

</details>

## Using metadata standards and schemas

While there are a few cross-discipline standards and schemas, they are mostly discipline specific. 

If you're planning to use a standard, it's best to identify the one you want to use before you start creating any metadata.

You can refer to a list of common standards for different disciplines provided by the [University of Texas at Austin here](https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/metadata-basics/domain-standards)s. 

You could also use the [metadata standard catalogue](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/search) to search available standards.

For more information about standards, take a look at unit 2.6 of the Introduction course.
