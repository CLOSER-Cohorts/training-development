## Metadata: a recap

Before we look at creating metadata, let's recap what metadata is.

Try answering the following questions in your own words.

<details>
<summary><b>What is metadata?</b></summary>
<p></p>
Metadata is a form of data documentation that describes data, giving us the context we need to understand data and use it in a meaningful way. It is often referred to as 'data about data'. 
  
</details>

\----

<details>
<summary><b>What are the features of metadata that differentiate from other forms of documentation?</b></summary>
<p></p>
Unlike other forms of free-text documentation, metadata is machine readable documentation. To be machine readable, metadata needs to be...
- Structured 
- Created and stored in machine readable formats
  - For example: CSV, XML, SAV, XLS, JSON, RDF, SHP

By being machine readable, metadata is also machine actionable. This means we can search and filter metadata on sites such as data repositories and data catalogues.

## What metadata should you create?

You may be a researcher or student about to conduct research project. How do you know what metadata to create?

There is no singular, universally-agreed set of minimum metadata standards. If you look on the internet, there are a variety of suggestions as to what metadata elements should be captured. This can be discipline or resource specific.

With extensive metadata, your data is more discoverable, understandable and (re)usable. However, the amount of metadata you create can be a trade-off between time and resource.

So, how do we decide what metadata to create?

## How to decide what metadata to create

**Core metadata elements for all research projects**<br>
While there is no one minimum metadata standard, there are core metadata elements that are commonly used across disciplines. This covers high level metadata about a research project; the who, what, where, when and how of the research. Beyond this set of core metadata, what metadata you create depends on the scope and aims of your research project.  

<p></p>

**To identify what metadata to create, you could consider the following questions ...**

<p></p>

\----

**Sharing data...**
- Do you plan to share your (meta)data or is it for personal reference only?
- If you're planning to share your (meta)data, how widely will you share it? 
- Will the people who interact with your (meta)data have direct contact with you and/or your research team?
  (_note, sharing metadata does not mean the data has to be open_)

<p></p>

<details>
<summary><b><mark>Sharing data: metadata considerations</mark></b></summary>
<p></p>

**Personal use**<br>
If you're not planning to share your data, you will be the main user of your metadata. You can choose metadata elements that will help you manage and preserve your data. The aim of this metadata is to help you conduct your research efficiently and help your future self to understand the data you collected. 

**Sharing data**<br>
If you're sharing (meta)data with external people who don't have direct with you, your metadata needs to provide a standalone guide to your research and data. In this scenario, metadata has the additional purpose to make your project discoverable and understandable for other people. As people won't be able to contact you easily to clarify confusing or missing information, it's important to make sure your metadata is clear, standardised and comprehensive from the get go. This means you will most likely create more metadata than a project that does not share it's (meta)data. Tools such as metadata standards and controlled vocabularies will also be fundamental in ensuring your metadata is interoperable and (re)usable by yourself and others. 

</details>

<p></p>

**Size of project...** <br>

- What is the scale of your research?
- How much data will you collect? How many different data collection methods will you use?
- How many researchers are working on the project?
- How many people will be creating the metadata?
- What time and resources do you have available?
- What software do you have available to use?

<p></p>

<details>
<summary><mark>Size of project: metadata considerations</mark></summary>
<p></p>

**Scale of research**<br>
If you're working on a large research project that handles a vast amount of data and data collection methods, you will need to create more metadata in order to effectively describe the different types of data and the processes undertaken to collect it. If it's a small research project, you will not need to create as much metadata.

**Research team**<br>
If you are working with a large research team, it is important to establish a clear metadata schema so metadata remains consistent and standardised. If there are multiple people creating, managing and using the metadata, following a schema will ensure the metadata remains consistent and easy to understand. If you are doing a solo research project, you may want to create your own metadata template. However, it can still be useful to follow a metadata schema and use controlled vocabularies in order to make sure your metadata is high quality.

**Time and resources**<br>
If you are working on a large research project, you may have more time and resource to create metadata. You could use specific metadata tools to help create and manage your metadata. If you are doing a small, solo project, you may not have the capacity to create extensive metadata or the access to metadata tools. In this scenario, it's important to prioritise the high value metadata for your research that support the aims of your project.

</details>

<p></p>

**One-off or repeated study...** <br>
- Is it a one-off study or a repeated study?
- If it is a repeated study, have there already been completed studies? What will the upcoming studies cover?

<p></p>

<details>
<summary><mark>One-off or repeated study: metadata considerations</mark></summary>
<p></p>

**Repeated study**<br>
If you are creating metadata for a repeated study, it is important to consider what metadata was captured for previous studies, including what schemas or standards were used. You should incoporate previous metadata structures into the metadata creation for any new research in the series in order to make sure your data is interoperable. If it's the first study of a series, it's important to create a robust metadata schema that can be reused for future studies.

**One-off study**<br>
For a one-off study, you have more felxibility about what metadata you create and/or what schema you use as it only needs to serve the aims of that individual project. However, it is still important to consider how you can make your (meta)data interoperable with other research projects in your field.

</details>

<p></p>

**Data repositories and catologues...** <br>
- Are you planning to deposit your (meta)data in a data repository and/or data catalogue?

<p></p>

<details>
<summary><mark>Data repositories and catologues: metadata considerations</mark></summary>
<p></p>

If you're depositing your (meta)data on data catalogues or data repositories, they may specify what metadata standards and controlled vocabularies to use. They may provide guidance or a metadata template/model, for example...
   - [CESSDA Data Model]( https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Resource-crd-2592) maps out the required metadata elements needed to deposit a dataset in their data cataologue
   - [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/deposit-data/prepare-your-data-for-deposit/) gives guidance on how to prepare your metadata and documentation 


Even if you're not planning to deposit your data in a repository or catalogue, they can provide easy-to-acess guidance on what metadata elements to capture and a ready made structure. You can download their metadata templates and models to use as a basis for your metadata creation.

</details>

\----

**Metadata standards and schemas...** 
- What common metadata standards are used in your discipline?
- What metadata schemas are widely available?
  
<details>
<summary><mark>Metadata standards and schemas</mark></b></summary>
<p></p>

It is good practice to identify common guidelines around metadata creation in your discipline or for a specific resource you are creating metadata for. This includes identifying widely used metadata standards and/or schemas. These can either provide the strucutre for your metadata creation or inform the approach you will take.
<p></p>

**Using metadata standards for a large research project with shared data** <br>
Using a metadata schema and standard is essential when you are planning to share your (meta)data and reposit your research in a repository and/or catalogue. Scehmas and standards ensure that your (meta)data is interoperable and can be integrated into larger centralised systems (such as repositories and catalogues). Moreover, if you're working on larger project alongside multiple researchers, schemas and standards are great way to standardise the language you use internally, reducing the risk of confusion and miscommnuication.

<p></p>

**Using metadata standards for a small research project where data is not shared** <br>
Even if you're not planning to share your (meta)data, metadata standards and schemas will save you time in choosing what metadata elements to capture and what structure to follow. While you don't have to follow the metadata standard or schema in it's entirety, you can use it as a basis for your metadata creation. This will help you organise your metadata in a consistent way. For example, they can also provide definitions for metadata elements, valid inputs for metadata fields and controlled vocabularies so your metadata is clear and consistent. 

<p></p>

While there are a few cross-discipline standards and schemas, they are mostly discipline specific. If you're planning to use a standard, it's best to identify the one you want to use before you start creating any metadata.

You can refer to a list of common standards for different disciplines provided by the [University of Texas at Austin here](https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/metadata-basics/domain-standards). You could also use the [metadata standard catalogue](https://rdamsc.bath.ac.uk/search) to search available standards.

For more information about standards, take a look at unit 2.6 of the Introduction course.

## How to create metadata

**What software should you use to create metadata?**
There's no singular software you should use to create and manage metadata. You can use any software that generates and supports machine readable formats. You may then export your metadata into text based formats such as PDF, in order to create further documentation but the original file must be machine readable.

There are tools and software that are designed specifically to generate, manage and store metadata. These tools can be particularly useful if you're doing a large project and need to capture extensive metadata.

Metadata tools include...

  - Online tools:
    - [Dublin Core Generator](https://nsteffel.github.io/dublin_core_generator/index.html)
  - Free open source tools:
    - [Collectica for Excel (standard)](https://www.colectica.com/software/colecticaforexcel/)
    - [Nesstar Publisher](https://www.ihsn.org/software/ddi-metadata-editor)
  - Commercial tools:
    - [Collectica for Excel (advanced packages), questionnaire, designer](https://www.colectica.com/software/)
   
You can further explore useful metadata tools here ...
- DCC provide a [list of metadata tools you can explore](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/guidance/standards/metadata/tools)
- UK Data service provide a [list of tools that can be used to explore and document data](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/exploring-data/uk-data-service-online-tools-for-exploring-data/)

Metadata tools can provide different different fucntionalities, for example: metadata management, quality review, repository compliance checkers, metadata mapping tools. Depending on your needs, you may want to use more than one tool in your metadata management.

You can also simply create metadata in an excel spreadsheet. If you're doing a small one-off project, this may be all you need. In the Foundation course, we will look at creating metadata in excel, using a metadata template to create metadata for a research project. 

**Where to create and store metadata**
Metadata can be stored in different locations. This includes ...
- Metadata can be stored in a spearate file alongside your data
- Metadata can be embedded in the data file

You may store metadata in one area or have both embedded and separate metadata files. It is important to keep a record of where your metadata is stored so you can easily extract it when necessary.

## Creating metadata in the Foundation unit

In the Foundation course, we will practice creating metadata, exploring common metadata elements. 

We will create metadata for ...

**Tabular data**<br>
While metadata can be created for any research project and data type, we will be focusing on metadata for tabular data. If you have tabular dataset you would like to create metadata for, have it open while completing this course. If you do not, you can download teaching datasets to practice on.

Open access teaching datasets are available from UKDS, and a list of them in the tab below.

<p></p>

If you do not regularly work with tabular data, the metadata elements and concepts this course covers are still relevant across disciplines and data types.

In the Foundation course we will mainly focus on creating metadata for small scale research projects, with the purpose of personal use or sharing with project collaborators. The metadata elements we explore will also be of use to those working on large scale projects whose (meta)data will be widely shared, however for these projects you will have to take in account further contextual considerations such as discipline specific metadata standards, controlled vocabularies and data repository/catalogue requirements.

For training purposes, we will create metadata in an excel file. However, depending on your research project and the tools you chose to use, you may create metadata in a different way/format.

**Excel for creating metadata**<br>
Excel is an accessible machine readable format. In excel, you can create a table to document your metadata for a research project. You can download the metadata template for the foundation course here XXX

Excel also has useful features that can help ensure your metadata is clean, well structured and standardised. For example, you can lock cells so that metadata element titles can't be changed or you can control what data can be inputted into certain metadata fields using data validation and and formatting tools. This allows us to implement contolled vocabularies in our metadata creation (to recap controlled vocabularies, go to unit 2.5 in the Introduction course).[1]

**Metadata for a small project**<br>
In this course, we will cover a core set of metadata elements that a research project can create. However, for larger research projects you will also have to capture further information.
