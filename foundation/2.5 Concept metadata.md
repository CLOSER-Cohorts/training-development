## What is a concept?

Concepts is a unit of meaning. They are an idea with a formal definition and a name, and they consist of a unique combination of characteristics. We can also group of examples of a concept together


A concept can be either a tangible object or and intangible idea.

For example...

Tangible concepts
- Person
- Apple
- Lion

Intangible concepts
- Gender
- Marital status
- Employment type
- Satisfaction with healthcare
- Academic discipline

A concept is represented by a designation. A designation is the number, text or symbol etc. that expresses a particular concept. One concept can have numerous designations.
Designations can be terms, codes, numerals or sumbols.

For example...
- Stop sign / traffic light sign 


If concepts are a unit of meaning, how do we define it?

For example, 

Lion 


We differentiate between concepts through these characteristics. 

For example,

## Concepts and research data

Concepts are a fundamental component in collecting data. Thinking back to the Concept -> Measure -> Data flow in the Introduction Course, concepts form the semantic foundation of research data, they describe what is being measured. For example, marital status.

A question, variable, or group of variables is designed to measure and describe a particular concept. For example, the question 'What is your marital status?' is designed to capture the concept 'marital status' of a person.

This means you can add concept metadata to your question or variable metadata.

For example ....

## Concepts and categories


Across different datasets, you might have different codelists to capture information about the same concept.

| Ex 1 | Ex 2      | Ex 3   | Ex 4              |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
|   S  | Single    | 1      | Never married     | 
|   M  | Married   | 2      | Married           | 
|   D  | Divorced  | 3      | Divorced          | 
|   W  | Widowed   | 4      | Widowed           | 
|      |           | 5      | Separated         | 
|      |           |        | Engaged           | 



Even though the representation is different, the concept that the data measures, marital status, remains the same.

Each of the categories that the codes in a codelist represent are also a concept in themselves

For example:
- Married
- Divorced
- Single
- Widowed
- Separated
- Engaged

This means you can have broader concepts which have fewer characteristics defining them and narrower concepts that have more characteristics.

For example, martial status refers to a person's situation with regard to whether one is single, married, separated, divorced, or widowed.[^1]

Whereas, the concept 'married' refers specifically to people who are united in marriage and have signed a legal document confirming their union.

## Including concepts in your metadata

You may want to add the concept you are measuring to your Variable, Question or Code metadata. 
In you excel, this can be done by adding a column.
