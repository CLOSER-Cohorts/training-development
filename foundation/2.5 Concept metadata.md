## What is a concept?

A concept is a unit of meaning. It is an idea with a formal definition and a name. For example:

- Age
- Income
- Marital Status
- Employment Type
- Satisfaction with Healthcare
- Academic Discipline

## Concepts are

If concepts are a unit of meaning, how can we define one?

Concepts consist of a unique combination of characteristics. We differentiate between concepts through these characteristics. 
For example:
- Lion and tiger example?

## Concepts and research data

Concepts are a fundamental component in collecting data. Thinking back to the Concept -> Measure -> Data flow in the Introduction Unit, concepts form the semantic foundation of research data â€” they describe what is being measured. For example, marital status.

A question, variable, or group of variables is designed to capture a particular concept. For example, the question 'What is your marital status?' is designed to mearure the marital status of a person.

This concept may be represented in different ways in a given dataset. For example:

| Ex 1 | Ex 2      | Ex 3   | Ex 4              |
|------|-----------|--------|-------------------|
|   S  | Single    | 1      | Never married     | 
|   M  | Married   | 2      | Married           | 
|   D  | Divorced  | 3      | Divorced          | 
|   W  | Widowed   | 4      | Widowed           | 
|      |           |        | Separated         | 
|      |           |        | Engaged           | 

Even though the representation is different, the concept that the data measures, marital status, remains the same.

The data coleccted for a particularly question or variable (whether code, numbers or text) also is a concept in itself. 
For example:
- Married
- Divorced
- Single
- Widowed

## Including concepts in your metadata

You may want to add the concept you are measuring to your Variable, Question or Code metadata. 
In you excel, this can be done by adding a column.
