## What is dataset metadata?
 
Like the study level metadata we explored in the previous unit, dataset metadata provides the who, what, when, why, where and how of a particular dataset. For larger research projects, you may produce multiple datasets. These datasets could have different areas of interest or be carried out in different locations or by a certain researcher. As such, the metadata for each dataset can vary. It will also offer more specific information than the overall project metadata, as it relates to a singular dataset within a research project.

However, we often use the same metadata elements used to capture information about the overall study and apply them at the dataset level.

**What metadata elements that we captured at the study level that we would also want to capture at the dataset level?**

<summary>Repeated metadata elements to capture for datasets</summary>

We can also capture additional metadata elements that we didn't cover in the study metadata to give further information about a dataset.

<p></p>

**What additional metadata elements should we collect for a dataset?**

<details>
<summary>New metadata elements to capture for datasets</summary>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Kind of data</b></li>
<li><b>Study</b></li>
 <ul>
 <li>The study that produced the dataset</li>
 </ul>
<li><b>Case quantity</b></li>
 <ul>  
 <li>The case quantity refers to number of data instances that were recorded (for tabular data, this is the number of rows)</li>
 </ul>
<li><b>Variables</b>
 <ul>  
 <li>How many variables are in the dataset</li>
 </ul>  
<li><b>Last Updated</b><li>
  - When the dataset was last updated
</ul>
 
</details>

>[!NOTE]
>Would the last couple around variables classify as variable metadata rather than dataset metadata? <br>
> BO - I think they fit fine here

## Practice: making dataset 

**Look at the example questionnaire and corresponding dataset below.**
