## What is dataset metadata?
 
Like the study level metadata we explored in the Introduction course, dataset metadata provides the who, what, when, why, where and how of a singular dataset. It provides specific information about how the data within a dataset was collected.

For larger research projects, you may produce multiple datasets. These datasets could have different areas of interest or be carried out in different locations or by a certain researcher. As such, having metadata for each dataset helps you manage vast amounts of data and saves you time in the future.

Many of the the metadata elements we use to describe the overall study can be reused at the dataset level.

??? question "What metadata elements we capture at the study level could we also capture at the dataset level?"

    Repeated metadata elements to capture for datasets
    - **Title**
      - the title of the dataset
    - **Creator**
      - the creator of the particular dataset
    - **Subject**
      - e.g. keywords or topics
    - **Description**
      - e.g. a description of the dataset and what it includes
    - **Contributor**
      - e.g. people or organisations who contributed to the research process
    **Date**
      - e.g. the date range of when the data for that dataset was collected
    - **Type**
    - **Format**
      - the format that the dataset is stored in
    **Language**
      - the language the dataset is stored in
    **Relation**
      - any other publications or resources that are related to that dataset
    **Coverage**
      - the geographical coverage of the dataset
    **Access rights**
      - the access rights of the individual dataset

    We can also capture additional metadata elements that we didn't cover in the study metadata to give further information about a dataset.


??? question "What additional metadata elements should we collect for a dataset?"

    New metadata elements to capture for datasets
    - **Kind of data**
    - **Study**
      - The study that produced the dataset
    - **Case quantity**
      - The case quantity refers to number of data instances that were recorded (for tabular data, this is the number of rows)</li>
    - **Variables**
      - How many variables are in the dataset
    - **Last Updated**
      - When the dataset was last updated

## Practice: creating dataset metadata

**Look at the example questionnaire and corresponding dataset below.**
