Where might you find high level metadata?

You will often see study level metadata on data repository and data catalogue pages.

It's useful to store high level data alongside your data files for your personal records. This allows you organise your research easily as well as come back to historical research and gain a quick understanding of what the project is about.

## Same term, different meanings 

Even within a research area, there may be different ways of saying the same thing. The way someone interprets the meaning of 'Date' and 'Creator' will alter what they put in that metadata field.

For example: 

What could 'Date' refer to?
- Date the research started
- Date the research ended
- Date the resource was published
- Date the metadata was published

What could 'Creator' refer to?
- Creator of the data
- Creator of metadata
- Person(s) / organisation(s)

What does 'Relation' mean in this setting?

If you don't define terms or terms are used inconsistently you will the utility of your metadata. 
What might be some of the challenges that arise?

- You don't know what the metadata is referring to, reducing the value of the metadata
- You can't compare the metadata with another study's metadata as they may be referring to different things
- You forget what definition you choose for a metadata element and don't know what your metadata is describing

As part of the metadata creation, you can define your metadata elements yoursels. For example ...

You can create this yourself, creating a metadata scheme that defines:
- Name of the metadata element
- Description of what it describes
- Valid input values

For example:
- Date
- Date the research was published
- dd/mm/yyyy

However, defining all your metadata elements independently can be time consuming. 

What tools can we use to ensure that metadata is consistent and structured?

Metadata elements: schemas and standards help you quickly 

Metadata input fields: controlled vocabularies

## Codebooks and data dictionaries 

We touched on codebooks and data dictionaries in the Introduction in unit 2.2.

When you create variable metadata, you can produce a codebook and/or data dictionary for your research.

For more guidance on how to create a codebook or data dictionary, follow these resources:

> Should data dictionaries be included here rather than left to the end? Could explain them here and at the end so they are repeated.
