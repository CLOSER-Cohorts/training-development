**Who should create study level metadata?** <br>
Regardless of whether you will deposit your (meta)data in a public repository or catalogue, all studies should capture study level metadata. Study level metadata is important for both discoverability (for others) and data management (for yourself).

**What study and dataset metadata should you create?** <br>
As we mentioned in the previous unit, while there is no universally agreed minimum metadata requirements, there are come core metadata elements to include for the study level.

---

Where might you find high level metadata?

You will often see study level metadata on data repository and data catalogue pages.

It's useful to store high level data alongside your data files for your personal records. This allows you organise your research easily as well as come back to historical research and gain a quick understanding of what the project is about.

## Same term, different meanings 

Even within a research area, there may be different ways of saying the same thing. The way someone interprets the meaning of 'Date' and 'Creator' will alter what they put in that metadata field.

For example: 

What could 'Date' refer to?
- Date the research started
- Date the research ended
- Date the resource was published
- Date the metadata was published

What could 'Creator' refer to?
- Creator of the data
- Creator of metadata
- Person(s) / organisation(s)

What does 'Relation' mean in this setting?

If you don't define terms or terms are used inconsistently you will the utility of your metadata. 
What might be some of the challenges that arise?

- You don't know what the metadata is referring to, reducing the value of the metadata
- You can't compare the metadata with another study's metadata as they may be referring to different things
- You forget what definition you choose for a metadata element and don't know what your metadata is describing

As part of the metadata creation, you can define your metadata elements yoursels. For example ...

You can create this yourself, creating a metadata scheme that defines:
- Name of the metadata element
- Description of what it describes
- Valid input values

For example:
- Date
- Date the research was published
- dd/mm/yyyy

However, defining all your metadata elements independently can be time consuming. 

What tools can we use to ensure that metadata is consistent and structured?

Metadata elements: schemas and standards help you quickly 

Metadata input fields: controlled vocabularies

## What metadata to create

## Finding what metadata you need to create for your research

**Core metadata elements**
While there is no one minimum metadata standard, there are common metadata elements that are key in research data management. This core metadata captures the high level metadata; the who, what, where, when and how of the research. How you document these metadata may be defined further if you are using a particular metadata standard and/or controlled vocabulary.

**Identifying metadata required for your research project**
Beyond this set of core metadata, what metadata you create depends on your individual project.

To identify what metadata elements to create, you should consider...

**Scope and aim of your research**
  - Is it a one-off study or a repeated study?
  - How many people will you share you data with? Is it an independent project for personal reference or will you make your data discoverable and available to others? If you're making your data discoverable to others, how widely do you want to share it? (note, this does not mean the data has to be open)
  - Do the poeple you are sharing your research with have direct contact with you and/or your research?
    
**Resources and time**
  - What software do you have available to use?
  - How many people will be creating the metadata?
    
**Discipline and research field**
  - What are the common standards and requirements in your discipline?
    
**Repository requirements**
 - If you plan to deposit your research in a repository, they often specify what metadata they require. You can see the requirments for depositing data on the repository website. They can sometimes be called metadata models. For example:
   - [CESSDA Data Model]( https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Resource-crd-2592) maps out the required metadata elements needed to deposit a dataset in their data cataologue
   - [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/deposit-data/prepare-your-data-for-deposit/) gives guidance on how to prepare your metadata and documentation 
  
## What metadata should I create?

There are many different ways we could describe data and, as such, there are many different elements we could capture. 

While the more metadata you create makes your data more discoverable, understandable and (re)usable, the amount of metadata you create it is a trade-off between time and resource.

There is no singular, universally-agreed set of minimum metadata standards. If you look on the internet, there are a variety of suggestions as to what should be required as a minimum standard. Often this discpline or resource specific.

So, how do we decide what metadata to create?

## Metadata for small research projects

If you're doing a one-off research project for personal use, you will be the main user of your metadata. As you do not need your research to be discoverable by other people, you may not have to create extensive metadata. Instead, you can choose metadata elements that will help you manage and preserve your data. Creating this metadata will help you conduct your research efficiently as well as help your future self to understand the data you collected. Even if the metadata you create is intended only for you, it is important to plan your metadata creation and management and follow best practices.
<p></p>
What challenges might arise if you don't plan your metadata approach and follow best practice?

<details>
<summary><b>Potential challenges in metadata creation</b></summary>
<p></p>

If we don't plan how we will create metadata and follow best practice ...
- Metadata creation can become time consuming
- The metadata we create is confusing and inconsistent, losing meaning or value
- Metadata is unique to this singular project reducing its reusability in other research projects you do in the future or it's interoperability if you decide to share your metadata in the future
- Increase chance of human error

</details>
   
In this unit, we will look at some common metadata elements at study, variable and question level in order to help simplify this process and help identify minimum about of metadata to create. We will also look at how we can apply some of the best practice tools we explored in the Introduction course, such as controlled vocabularies (unit 2.5) and metadata standards (unit 2.6), when creating metadata.

## Metadata for large research projects

If you are working on a large research project that handles a vast amount of data, you will need to create more metadata in order to effectively describe the research processes and different types of data the research contains. 

If you are sharing (meta)data with external people who don't have direct with you, your metadata needs to provide a standalone guide to your research and data. As people won't be able to contact you easily to clarify documentation or missing information, it's important to make sure your metadata is clear, standardised and comprehensive from the get go. Tools such as metadata standards and controlled vocabularies will be fundamental in ensuring your metadata is interoperable and (re)usable by yourself and others.

If you're depositing your (meta)data on data catalogues or data repositories, you will need to ensure that you create all the required metadata elements, following any specified metadata standards and/or controlled vocabularies.

---

## Using metadata tools to decide what metadata to create

Using tools such data repositories, data catalogues, schemas and standards can help define what metadata elements to create, saving you time deciding yourslef.


**Data repositories and catalogues**<br>
Even if you're not planning to deposit your data, data catalogues and schemas can be a great place to get initial guidance or advice.

For example, here is some advice on what metadata to create provided by data catalogues ...
- [CESSDA Metadata model](https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Resource-crd-2592) gives a alist of metadata elements marking them mandatory, recommended and optional. It gives a description of each element as well as recommended controlled vocabularies.
- [UK Data Service](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/help/deposit-data/prepare-your-data-for-deposit/) gives guidance on how to prepare your metadata and documentation 

**Metadata schemas and standards**<br>
Metadata schemas and standards are a ready-made framework for describing data and related information. It provides a consistent way to structure your metadata by using predefined fields with valid inputs. This not only saves you time by specifying what metadata to create, it also ensures your metadata is compatible with other metadata using the same standard, enabling sharing and comparing across projects. 

<details>
<summary><b>Using standards / schemas for small research projects</b></summary>
<p></p>
Why use metadata schemas and standards even if you don't plan to share your data?

You may not have the time or need to use a full metadata standard or schema, however using one to inform you metadata creation will provide you with many benefits.

For example ...

**Organising your research:** These tools help you organise your research data in a consistent way. It saves you time deciding what metadata fields to create and what input should be allowed as the standard alreadt specifies this. If you come back to your data in six months or years, clear metadata will help you remember what everything means and how to use it again.

**Clarity and understanding:** When writing a paper about your data, you'll need to explain your data collection methods and results clearly. Using a schema ensures you capture all the necessary details from the start, like how you measured “satisfaction” and what the scale meant.

**Future sharing:** Even if your research isn’t shared now, in the future, you may want to deposit it in a repository. If you use a common metadata standard from the start, the transition to data sharing will be smoother.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Using standards / schemas for for large shared project</b></summary>
<p></p>

If you want to share your (meta)data widely and deposit it in a repository or catalogue, using a metadata schema and standard is essential in ensuring you data is interoperable. Moreover, if you're working on larger project alongside multiple researchers, schemas and standards are great way to standardise the language you use internally, reducing the risk of confusion and miscommnuication.

**Collaboration:** in larger research projects there will often be multiple people working with a dataset and managing/creating metadata. Metadata standards aids this collaborative working environment, ensuring you are using the same definitions and valid inputs for metadata elements and fields. This ensures your metadata is clean and high quality.

**Sharing your (meta)data:**

**Interoperability:** Standards also make your metadata interoperable, meaning it is easier to exchange, process, and compare information across systems and tools. The more people who adopt a standard, the more powerful and effective it becomes.

## Codebooks and data dictionaries 

We touched on codebooks and data dictionaries in the Introduction in unit 2.2.

When you create variable metadata, you can produce a codebook and/or data dictionary for your research.

For more guidance on how to create a codebook or data dictionary, follow these resources:


>[!NOTE]
> Should data dictionaries be included here rather than left to the end? Could explain them here and at the end so they are repeated.

## Unit of measurement

>[!NOTE]
>BO - It's common to use multiple units of measurement e.g. lots of studies ask respondents to provide their age in years and months (see the last example here https://ucldata.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOS/pages/37324672/Age-related+examples). Same for height and weight (see example 2 here https://ucldata.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CLOS/pages/37324678/Physical+measurements+examples). So should we be saying that you "should" only use one unit of measurement, rather than you "can" only use one unit of measurement? Or maybe it's better to say that if you use multiple units of measurement, you should later be combined them into a single unit of measurement or data point e.g. if you ask for age in years and months, you'd combine "1 year" with "1 month" to give you "13 months" for the purpose of your data analysis? Sorry if this sounds picky, I just don't want us to confuse people if they're used to seeing multiple units of measurement.<br>
> JJ - BO - true, but I think the point is to say that what should end up in a single column of data should be of the same unit of measurement, ie the data collection might be. I think this is point to be made in the foundational section, so perhaps removed the second paragraph

## Unit type and population

Unlike population, Universe does not sepcify time and geography. However the Universe is linked to a certain Population, so it can be contextualised by the time and geography that is writtern in the Population metadata. While the Population refers to the group actually studied, the Universe is the larger group that the study's conclusions might apply to, based on the sample.
