## Recap

In the basic training we covered:

**Research data**
 - Understanding research data as concept --> measure --> representation 
 - FAIR data principles
 - Research data management
  
**Metadata**
 - Definition of metadata and the different types of metadata
 - How metadata relates to data management and FAIR principles
 - Metadata in the data lifecycle
      
**Metadata components**
 - Controlled vocabularies
 - Metadata schemas and standards

 ##  Aim of Foundation course

Now we have covered the main concepts, tools and benefits of metadata, the foundation course will look at how to create metadata for your own research.

We will focus on your role as a metadata creator, exploring:

**How to create metadata**
  - Tools to create and capture metadata
  - When to create metadata 
  - Where to store metadata
    
**What metadata to create**
  - Identify what metadata elements to capture
  - Using metadata standards

**Creating metadata**
  - In foundation, we will look at common metadata elements for the following areas:
    - Study metadata
    - Variable metadata
    - Question metadata
    - Codes and categories
    - Concept metadata
    
**Utilising metadata**
  - Mapping metadata
  - Codebooks and data dictionaries

We will look at creating metadata predominantly for quantitative, tabular data (data found in tables). We will also look at how you can create metadata for data collection instruments such as questionnaires and surveys.

## Who should create metadata?

All research should have some level of metadata to describe what the project is about and what data it contains.

What metadata you create, how you create it and who share it with will depend on the scope and aim of your research.

Broadly speaking, a metadata creation approach is influenced by whether you working on small project that does not plan to share it's metadata or data widely, 

**Small independent project**<br>
If you're independently working on a small research project and will not not share you data publicly (or will only share it with a small number of individuals who have direct contact with you), then you may want a more streamlined approach to creating metadata. Your metadata will be mainly for personal use or the referred to by a small number of people.

<summary><b>Benefits of creating metadata for personal use</b></summary>
<p></p> 

-	Helps you understand your data when you reference it in the future
-	Enables you build on your research when designing future projects
-	Implement best practice
-	If you decide to share your data with other people, it's easy to access and understand

</details>

**Large research project with shared metadata and/or data**<br>
However, if you're working on a project that will be publicly discoverable and shared with a large number of people then you will need a more robust approach to creating metadata. 

Your metadata will be a vital tool in making your project findable and accessible by external people who do not have direct contact with you and/or the research team. In addition, if you deposit your (meta)data in a data repository or catalogue, youâ€™ll need to ensure it meets the requirements of the repository or catalogue and that the metadata is standardised and interoperable.

<summary><b>Benefits of creating metadata for personal use</b></summary>
<p></p> 
 
-	Allows others who do not have a link to you or your research project to discover and understand your study
-	Promotes data citation of your work
-	Enables re-use of your data and cross-study comparisons
-	Standardised metadata will allow people who do not have links to you or your research project to effectively understand what the data is about with minimal confusion
-	Saves you time answering queries about your data
-	Promotes FAIR principles, allowing you to adhere to best practice

In the Foundation course, we will mainly be looking at metadata creation that for small independent resarch projects. While the metadata elements we look at will be relevant for both small and large scale research projects, large research projects that wish to share their project more widely and deposit their data in a repository or catalogue, will have to take further considerations in their metadata creation. That will often have to follow specific metadata schemas and templates that will prescribe metadata elements and their valid inputs.
