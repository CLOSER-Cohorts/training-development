##  Aim of Foundation course

Now we have covered the essentials for using and understanding metadata including the benefits to yourself, others and the wider community, the Foundation course will build on this and will introduce additional foundational metadata principles which are key to understanding how to manage metadata and data, before going on to how to make decisions about what and how to create metadata. Finally, we will look at how to create metadata for your own research.

We will explore: 

- 1 Introduction
   - 1.1 Who should create metadata?
   - 1.2 Why create metadata?
- 2 Core metadata elements
   - 2.1 Unit type, Population and Universe
   - 2.2 Question metadata
      - 2.21 Codes and Categories
  - 2.3 Variable metadata
  - 2.4 Concept metadata
- 3 Metadata relationships
- 4 What metadata should you create?
  - 4.1 What study metadata
  - 4.2 What dataset metadata
  - 4.3 What variable metadata 
- 5 Creating your own metadata activity

We will look at creating metadata predominantly for quantitative, tabular data (data found in tables), and use examples focused on metadata for data collection instruments such as questionnaires and surveys.

## Creating metadata in the Foundation course

In the Foundation course, we will explore creating metadata for a small research project that has produced tabular data. We will use an excel template to practice creating metadata. 

=== "For tabular data"

    While metadata can be created for any research project and data type, we will be focusing on **metadata for tabular data**. If you have tabular dataset you would like to create metadata for, have it open while completing this course. If you do not regularly work with tabular data, the metadata elements and concepts this course covers are still relevant across disciplines and data types.

=== "Based on a small research project"

    In the Foundation course, we will mainly focus on creating metadata for small scale research projects, with the purpose of personal use or sharing with project collaborators. 

    The metadata elements we explore will also be relevant to those working on large scale projects whose (meta)data will be widely shared, however, for these projects, you will have to take into account further contextual considerations such as discipline specific metadata standards, controlled vocabularies and data repository/catalogue requirements.

=== "Using excel"

    To practice metadata creation in the Foundation unit, we will use an excel metadata template. However, depending on your research project and the tools you chose to use, you may create and manage metadata using different software.

    While Excel is not an machine readable format itself, it can be exported or transformed into machine readable formats, if the file follows a clear strucutre, data is clean and it doesn't rely on extra formatting such as colour, merged cells or notes.
