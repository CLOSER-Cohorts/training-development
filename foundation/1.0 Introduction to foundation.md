## Recap

In the basic training we covered:

**Research data**
 - Understanding research data as concept --> measure --> representation
 - FAIR data principles
 - Research data management
  
**Metadata**
 - Definition of metadata and the different types of metadata
 - How metadata relates to data management and FAIR principles
 - Metadata in the data lifecycle
      
**Metadata components**
 - Controlled vocabularies
 - Metadata schemas and standards

 ##  Aim of Foundation course

Now we have covered the main concepts, tools and benefits of metadata, the foundation course will look into how to create metadata for your own research,

We will focus on your role as a metadata creator, exploring:

**How to create metadata**
  - Tools to create and capture metadata
  - When to create metadata 
  - Where to store metadata
    
**What metadata to create**
  - Identify what metadata elements to capture
  - Using metadata standards

**Creating metadata**
  - In foundation, we will look at common metadata elements for the following areas:
    - Study metadata
    - Variable metadata
    - Question metadata
    - Codes and categories
    - Concept metadata
    
**Utilising metadata**
  - Mapping metadata
  - Codebooks and data dictionaries

We will look at creating metadata predominantly for quantitative, tabular data (data found in tables). We will also look at how you can create metadata for data collection instruments such as questionnaires and surveys.

## Different projects will create and store data in different ways

All research should have some level of metadata accompanying it's data.

What metadata you create, how you create it and where you store it will depend on the scope, aim and intention of your research.

If the metadata is only for your personal use, you may want a more streamlined approach. However, if the metadata will be shared and/or your data is deposited in a repository or catalogue, you’ll need to ensure it is comprehensive, standardised, and complies with best practices for transparency, reusability, and discoverability.

For example:
- Small one-off research project which is for personal use (not shared) or shared with a small pool of individuals who have direct contact with the research creator
- A research project that is publicly discoverable and shared with a wide pool of people who are not in direct contact with the research creator. For example, stored on online repositories (note, this does not mean the data is open)

## Small, one-off research project

It is always important to build metadata creation into your research process, no matter how small the project!

Why should you create metadata for an individual project that only you or small group of known people will be referencing? What do you think the benefits would be?

<details>
<summary><b>Benefits of creating metadata for personal use</b></summary>
<p></p> 

-	Helps you understand your data when you reference it in the future
-	Enables you build on your research when designing future projects
-	Implement best practice
-	If you decide to share your data with other people, it's easy to access and understand

</details>

However, as it is a small project, you may not have the need or resources to create extensive metadata. In the Foundation course, we will explore how to approach metadata creation so you can identify what metadata will be most useful to create as core documentation.

## Large, shared research project

If you’re planning to share your (meta)data and/or deposit your (meta)data in a repository, you will need to caputre more metadata elements in order to provide more information about the research. This includes identifying relevant metadata standards, controlled voacabularies, data repositories (following their requirements for depositing your data) and widely accessible formats. How much metadata to create and what tools to use will further depend on how and where you want to share your (meta)data.

Why should you create metadata for shared projects? What are the benefits?

<summary><b>Benefits of creating metadata for personal use</b></summary>
<p></p> 
 
-	Allows others who do not have a link to you or your research project to discover your study
-	Promotes data citation and cross study comparisons
-	Standardised metadata will allow people who do not have links to you or your research project to effectively understand what the data is about with minimal confusion
-	Saves you time answering queries about your data
-	Promotes FAIR principles, allowing you to adhere to best practice
