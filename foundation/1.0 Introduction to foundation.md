## Recap

In the basic training we covered:

**Research data**
 - Understanding research data as concept --> measure --> representation 
 - FAIR data principles
 - Research data management
  
**Metadata**
 - Definition of metadata and the different types of metadata
 - How metadata relates to data management and FAIR principles
 - Metadata in the data lifecycle
      
**Metadata components**
 - Controlled vocabularies
 - Metadata schemas and standards

 ##  Aim of Foundation course

Now we have covered the main concepts, tools and benefits of metadata, the foundation course will look at how to create metadata for your own research.

We will focus on your role as a metadata creator, exploring:

**How to create metadata**
  - Tools to create and capture metadata
  - When to create metadata 
  - Where to store metadata
    
**What metadata to create**
  - Identify what metadata elements to capture
  - Using metadata standards

**Creating metadata**
  - In foundation, we will look at common metadata elements for the following areas:
    - Study metadata
    - Variable metadata
    - Question metadata
    - Codes and categories
    - Concept metadata
    
**Utilising metadata**
  - Mapping metadata
  - Codebooks and data dictionaries

We will look at creating metadata predominantly for quantitative, tabular data (data found in tables). We will also look at how you can create metadata for data collection instruments such as questionnaires and surveys.

## Different projects will create and store data in different ways

All research should have some level of metadata accompanying it's data.

What metadata you create, how you create it and where you store it will depend on the scope, aim and intention of your research.

If the metadata is only for your personal use, you may want a more streamlined approach. 
For example:

If you're independently working on a small research project and will not not share you data publicly (or will only share it with a small number of individuals who have direct contact with you), then you may want a more streamlined approach to creating metadata. Your metadata will be mainly for personal use or the referred to by a small number of people.

<p></p> 

-	Helps you understand your data when you reference it in the future
-	Enables you build on your research when designing future projects
-	Implement best practice
-	If you decide to share your data with other people, it's easy to access and understand

</details>

However, if you're working on a project that will be publicly discoverable and shared with a large number of people who are not in direct contact with you and/or the research team, then you will need a more robust approach to creating metadata. Metadata will not only need to serve your personal needs, but will need to enable your project to be findable, accessible and interoperable. For exmaple, if you deposit your (meta)data in a data repository or catalogue (note, this does not mean your data is open), youâ€™ll need to ensure it is comprehensive and standardised.

<p></p> 
 
-	Allows others who do not have a link to you or your research project to discover your study
-	Promotes data citation and cross study comparisons
-	Standardised metadata will allow people who do not have links to you or your research project to effectively understand what the data is about with minimal confusion
-	Saves you time answering queries about your data
-	Promotes FAIR principles, allowing you to adhere to best practice
