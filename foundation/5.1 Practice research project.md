## Practice research project

After exploring the metadata elements, you can practice what you've learnt using a small teaching dataset based on the 2011 Young Life and Times Survey delivered by ARK in Northern Ireland. The full dataset has been deposited on the UK Data Service and [can be seen here](https://datacatalogue.ukdataservice.ac.uk/studies/study/7058#details).

**Research practice example**

Imagine you're a social science researcher who has collected data using the survey below.

Through conducting this research you create the following dataset.

**Dataset title:** 7058_ylt11 teaching dataset

You want to make sure you preserve your data, documenting it clearly for your own records and share documentation where needed to colleagues and collaborators. In the Foundation course we will cover metadata we can create to capture key information about the dataset, variables and data collection method.

If you want to use an alternative teaching dataset, you can find more on the UK Data Service. Expand the box below to explore more.

??? info "List of Open Access Teaching datasets from UKDS"

        - 2021 Census: Public Microdata Teaching Sample (England and Wales): 1% Sample: Open Access
        - British Social Attitudes Survey, 2021, Health Care and Equalities: Open Access Teaching Dataset
        - British Social Attitudes Survey, 2019, Poverty and Welfare: Open Access Teaching Dataset
        - British Social Attitudes Survey, 2017, Environment and Politics: Open Access Teaching Dataset
        - SN 7913 Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, Well-Being Module, April-May 2015: Unrestricted Access Teaching Dataset
        - SN 7912 Quarterly Labour Force Survey, January - March, 2015: Unrestricted Access Teaching Dataset

    You can download one of these datasets to practice metadata creation in the Foundation unit. In order to do this, you can download the dataset as a CSV or Excel file and download the user guide for the data so you have the background information about the dataset.

## Using the metadata template

**Metadata template structure**

The metadata template is strucutred into five tabs...
1. Dataset metadata (links to unit 2.2)
2. Variable metadata (links to unit 2.3)
3. Question metadata (links to unit 2.4)
4. Codes and categories metadata (links to unit 2.5)

Each tab contains a metadata template to describe different areas of the research project. Each metadata element is linked to a definition and we will cover each one in this course. You can also add more elements to this template if you need to capture further information. If you add metadata elements it is important to define them and specify what information should be captured.

**Tools to support metadata creation in excel** 

Excel has features that can help ensure your metadata is clean, structured and standardised. For example, you can lock cells so that metadata element titles can't be changed or you can control what data can be inputted into certain metadata fields using data validation tools. This helps us to implement contolled vocabularies in our metadata creation (to recap controlled vocabularies, go to unit 2.5 in the Introduction course) and reduces risk of human errors[1].

You can also download tools compatible with excel. For example [Collectica for Excel](https://www.colectica.com/software/colecticaforexcel/) is an add-on for Excel which includes pre-defined metadata elements where you can input your metadata direclty into the dataset file (rather than having a separate Excel file for your metadata).

>[!NOTE]
>SW - once all content is finalised can a link to 'controlled vocabularies' be applied here? (and for other references to previous course content throughout)? 

Throughout the course we'll also be thinking about how to make our metadata sure metadata is consistent, well structured and high quality. We will apply some of the tools we covered in the Introduction course such as controlled vocabularies, metadata standards and schemas.
