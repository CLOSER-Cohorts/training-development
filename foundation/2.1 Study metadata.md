## What is study metadata?

As we covered in the Introduction course, study metadata captures information about the whole research effort. This metadata provides context on the who, what, when, why, where and how of the overall research study. It also describes where the study's datasets are located and how they can be accessed.

Study level metadata may also be called catalogue metadata, as it's the metadata often required by data repositories and data catalogues. This metadata helps users of these sites to understand and discover different research studies.

Study metadata is also important for your personal records, even if you're not planning to deposit you data in a data repository or catalogue. Study metadata allows you to organise your research effectively, as well as preserve it for future use so you can come back to it at a later date and have all the necessary information to hand.

## Study metadata elements

In the last unit of the Introduction course, we took a look at creating study metadata using Dublin Core.

Thinking back to this unit, can you list what metadata elements you might want to capture for a study?

<p></p>

Below are some core metadata elements for study metadata. The elements marked with (R) should be considered required metadata that all studies complete. The elements marked with (O) are optional metadata that can be completed if relevant and necessary.

- **Title** (R)
  - the title of the research study
- **Creator** (R)
  - the creator of the data, this could be the PI of the study
- **Subject** (R)
  - e.g. keywords or topics
- **Description** (R)
  - e.g. an abstract or table of contents
- **Contributor** (O)
  - e.g. people or organisations who contributed to the research process
- **Date** (R)
  - e.g. the date range the research was conducted, the end date of the research etc.
- **Type** (R)
- **Format** (R)
  - the format that the data is stored in
- **Language** (R)
  - the language the data is stored in
- **Relation** (O)
  - any other publications or resources that are related to the study
- **Coverage** (R)
  - the geographical coverage of the research study as a whole

If you're working on a larger research study and you're planning to share your data, you may want to include more metadata elements, such as...

- **Funder** (O)
  - If the research study is recieving funding, the name of the organisations providing funding
- **Publisher** (O)
  - If the research study 
- **Access rights** (O)
  - If the (meta)data for the research study is shared online, you need to state the access rights to the data 
- **Identifier** (O)
  - If information about the research study and/or its data is available online, you should provide a DOI or PID to the online location

If you are depositing your data in a repository or catalogue, it is important to check the metadata requirements of those sites to ensure to capture any further metadata elements.

>[!NOTE]
>In Intro course I used **project** level metadata instead of **study** level metadata however I'm thinking of changin this to study level as well as DDI uses the term 'study' and I want the course to start reflecting DDI terms where possible
> BO - are we changing to "catalogue metadata"?
