## Study level metadata

Study level metadata contains high level information about the research project, providing context on what, when, why, where and how of the data.

---
## Example of study level

_Screenshot of study level metadata - data catalogue page_

You will often see study level metadata on data repository pages.

---
## Who should create study level metadata

Regardless of whether you will deposit your (meta)data in a public repository, all projects should capture study level metadata.
Study level metadata is important for both discoverability (for others) and data management (for yourself).

---
## Here is an example of study level metadata

## What study level metadata to create

As we mentioned in the previous unit, while there is no universally agreed minimum metadata standard, there are come core metadata elements to include for the study level.

Some core metadata elements:

1. Title	
2. Creator	
3. Subject	
4. Description	
5. Publisher	
6. Contributor
7. Date
8. Type
9. Format
10. Identifier
11. Language
12. Relation
13. Coverage
14. Rights

# Same term, different meanings 

Even within a research area, there may be different ways of saying the same thing. 

For example: 

What does 'Date' refer to?
- Date the research started
- Date the research ended
- Date the resource was published
- Date the metadata was published

What could 'Creator' refer to?
- Creator of the data
- Creator of metadata
- Peron(s) / organisation(s)

What does 'Relation' mean in this setting?

Even within a research area, there may be different ways of saying the same thing. The way someone interprets the meaning of 'Date' and 'Creator' will alter what they put in that field.

# Undefined and/or inconsitent terms

What are the challenges of inconsisentent or undefined terms?
- You don't know what the metadata is referring to, reducing the value of the metadata
- You can't compare the metadata with another study's metadata as they may be referring to different things
- You forget what definition you choose for a metadata element and don't know what your metadata is describing

---
## Example: Defining 'Date' and 'Creator'

As part of the metadata creation, it is important to define what your metadata elements are.

You can create this yourself, creating a metadata scheme that defines:
- Name of the metadata element
- Description of what it describes
- Valid input values

For example:
- Date
- Date the research was published
- dd/mm/yyyy

However, defining all your metadata elements independently can be time consuming. 
What tools could we use to help define our metadata elements.

---
## Defining metadata elements and input values

Metadata elements: schemas and standards help you quickly 

Metadata input fields: controlled vocabularies  

---
## Example: Defining 'Date', 'Creator' and 'Relation' using a metadata standard

The core elements listed above are based on the Dublin Core Schem

## Tools to create Study level metadata
 
 - Dublin Core Schema
   - Dublin Core Generator
   
---

## Creating study level metadata

In the excel sheet create dataset metadata for your research.
You can also create the metadata

## Implementing best practice 

- Controlled vocabularies
- Checking repository requirements
