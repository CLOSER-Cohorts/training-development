Reminder that this is managing the metadata not the data itself

Managing metadata could be considered to be managing the relationships between different types of content. Group real world things of the same type (categorise), and linking them by their relationship, making it more understandable by humans and computers/machines (know what the thing is, how it works with other things and what to do with it). It means we can create tools to support researchers, and data managers e.g. searching for variables, or understanding what a variable is more easily, pipelines. 

It also helps when you understand how things relate to each other for your research and for reuse.
