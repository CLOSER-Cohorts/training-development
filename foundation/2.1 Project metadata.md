## High level metadata

As we covered in the introduction course in unit 2.2, high level metadata contains information about the research project, providing context on what, when, why, where and how of the data.

Where might you find high level metadata?

You will often see study level metadata on data repository and data catalogue pages.

It's useful to store high level data alongside your data files for your personal records. This allows you organise your research easily as well as come back to historical research and gain a quick understanding of what the project is about.

**Who should create high level metadata?** <br>
Regardless of whether you will deposit your (meta)data in a public repository or catalogue, all projects should capture high level metadata. High level level metadata is important for both discoverability (for others) and data management (for yourself).

**What high level metadata should you create?** <br>
As we mentioned in the previous unit, while there is no universally agreed minimum metadata standard, there are come core metadata elements to include for the study level.

Thinking back to the introduction unit, what metadata elements could we include in high level metadata?

Some core metadata elements...

- Title
  - the title of the research project
- Creator
  - the creator of the data
- Subject
  - e.g. keywords or topics
- Description
  -e.g. an abstract or table of contents
- Contributor
  - e.g. eople or organisations who contributed to the research process
- Date
  - e.g. the date range the research was conducted, the end date of the research etc.
- Type
- Format
  - the format that the data is stored in
- Language
  - the language the data is stored in
- Relation
  - any other publications or resources that are related to the project
- Coverage
  - the geographical coverage of the research

If you're working on a larger research project and you're planning to share your data, you may want to include more metadata elements, such as...

- Funder
  - If the research project is recieving funding, the name of the organisations providing funding
- Publisher
  - If the research project 
- Rights
  - If the (meta)data for the research project is shared online, you need to state the access rights to the data 
- Identifier
  - If information about the research project and/or its data is available online, you should provide a DOI or PID to the online location
