## FOUNDATION OVERVIEW

---
## Aim and objectives

**Objective:** Build on introduction to metadata. Applying knowledge of metadata into metadata creation.

**Aim:** Participants will understand how to approach metadata creation: how to create metadata, what metadata elements to create, where to create it and when. They will be able to identify what metadata creation tools they need and how they can apply best practice in metadata creation.

---
## Audience and delivery

**Audience**
- Focus on metadata creators (still touching on benefits for metadata users)
  - Participants: masters/doctoral students, early career researchers, data managers, funders
    - Cross-discipline with included focus on survey/questionnaire based research
  - Train the trainers: course tutors, doctoral students, librarian/learning centres

**Delivery**
- Mode: Remote
  - In first instance, training is developed on github and exported to interactive website with ppt and pdf materials
  - Interactive elements, e.g. links to case studies, worked examples examples, embedded videos and suggestions of activities to complete on own research
- Features: videos (also make available on youtube), worked group examples (with answers supploed in the course), application to dataset

---
## Resources

**Accompanying resources:**
- Excel spreadsheet template: sheet for study level metadata, variable metadata, question metadata, codes/categories metadata, concept metadata
- Template dataset (for those who do not use their own)
- Worksheet (?) â€“ summary of activities that the course will include with spaces for their answers
- Takeaway resource: overview booklet that contains a high-level summary of content (to be available for download / made available to participants once they have completed the course). This should include templates which could be useful for their work and list of external tools and resources available on other sites

**Training resources:**
- Training guidance handbook (short pdf handout)
- Material available to export as ppt for delivery

Participant resource requirements: bring own dataset (specification needs to be set out for dataset), nor prior learning to require
