## Idenitfying variables

Take a look at this dataset recording data from a survey. What are the variables in this dataset?

| f_n  | h   | b_d        | m_s  | 
|------|-----|------------|------|
| John | 178 | 1998-09-02 | S    |
| Gill | 200 | 1934-06-12 | M    |
| Alice| 182 | 1922-12-24 | M    |

## Idenitfying variables

The variables are:

- f_n
- h
- b_d
- m_s

## What are variables?

[discussion question]

## Variable definition

Variable is a characteristic of a unit being observed. A variable might be the answer of a question, have an administrative source, or be derived from other variables.* 

In rectangular data, a variable describes the data within the column (they can often be found the column heading).

Example of a variable:
- Height
- Weight
- Age

Example of a derived variable:
- BMI: calculated from height, weight and age

## Why should we record variable metadata?

Personal benefit
- Overview of your data and what you recorded
- Helpful for your future self to understand your data

Discoverability of data
- Variable metadata search on repositories
- Example
  - UK Data Service example
  - ICSPR: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/ICPSR/ssvd/
  - CLOSER example

Interoperability and (re)usability of data
- Leads to cross study comparison
- Example
  - Compare feature on repositories above

---

## Exercise - using variable metadata to search datasets 
- Demonstrate discoverability of data
  
---

## What metadata should you create?

- Variable name
- Variable label
- Variable description
- Value representation
- Data type
- Unit of measurement
- Valid range
- Missing values
- Unit type 
- Population
- Source variables

## Variable name, label and description

First of all, you need to describe the variable itslef. The variable name, label and description are often the starting point for variable metadata.

| name | label          | description          |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| f_n  | first name     | Full legal first name, no nicknames
| s    | sex            | Self-reported biological sex
| h    | height         | Height calculated to nearest cm
| b_d  | birthdate      | Date of birth yyyy/mm/dd
| m_s  | martial status | Self-reported marital status

- Variable name: the term  used in your dataset e.g. f_n, h, b_d, m_s
- Variable label: A short, clear label describing the variable
- Variable description: A longer explanation of what the variable measures. Sometimes this includes how the variable was collected and what measurement was used. Add enough detail so that someone new to your research could understand.

## Value represenation and data type

Next, you need to describe the type of data the variable collects.

| name | label          | description                         |  Value representation          |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| f_n  | first name     | Full legal first name, no nicknames | text
| s    | sex            | Self-reported biological sex        | code
| h    | height         | Height calculated to nearest cm     | numeric
| b_d  | birthdate      | Date of birth yyyy/mm/dd            | date
| m_s  | martial status | Self-reported marital status        | code

- Value representation describes the structure and the content of the variable
  - For example: text, numeric, date, code, scale, geographic, image, symbol

_Should data type be included for the small projects? If so, what guidance should be give?_
- Data type defines what type of 
  - NUmeric, string, boolean

## Unit type and population

Now we've describe what the variable is and the data it contains, we need to describe what/who the data is about.

**Unit type**

The unit type is the unit of observation or unit of analysis in your research. It is usually a primary entity, for example: individual, household, establishment, country, dog, apple

**Population**

The Population contextualises the unit type by time and space. It refers to the specific group of individuals or entities from which the data is drawn. Population may include the time or geographical area to which the population is associated.

For example: Adults aged 18-30 in the U.S. as of 2019, Households in urban areas in 2007, All employees in the tech industry in 2012, Dogs in Woof Re-Home Centre during 2016 - 2020

**Universe**

A Universe contextualizes a Unit Type by providing additional delimiting characteristics, defining a certain class of entity, people, objects or events. 

Unlike population, Universe has no specification of time and geography, contextualizing a Unit Type. While the Population refers to the group actually studied, the Universe is the larger group that the study's conclusions might apply to, based on the sample.

For example:
Persons with a university degree, Retail business establishments




May also be defined by what it excludes
Example: People except those with a university degree
Hierarchical universe, example: 
Persons with a university degrees
Persons with an economics degree (Master Degree in Economics)

Note – with universe descriptions we mean “All …”
“All“ could be added to the description, but it is not necessary

## How can we ensure variable metadata is high quality?
_Recap controlled vocabularies, metadata standards. Interoperability_

---

## You can add more metadata!

We are just covering some basic metadata elements however you can add more elememts depending on what data you need to describe.

---

## How to collect variable metadata

You can collect metadata 

---

## What we can do with metadata codebooks

Explain what a codebook is.
Give example of a codebook.
Why codebooks are important.

---

## Practice making variable metadata

[Worked example exercise - give people a dataset and ask them to create the variable metadata]
[Encourage people to make variable metadata for their data]
