## Idenitfying variables

Take a look at this dataset recording data from a survey. What are the variables in this dataset?

| f_n  | h   | b_d        | m_s  | 
|------|-----|------------|------|
| John | 178 | 1998-09-02 | S    |
| Gill | 200 | 1934-06-12 | M    |
| Alice| 182 | 1922-12-24 | M    |

## Idenitfying variables

The variables are:

- f_n
- h
- b_d
- m_s

## What are variables?

[discussion question]

## Variable definition

'Variable is a characteristic of a unit being observed. A variable might be the answer of a question, have an administrative source, or be derived from other variables' 

In rectangular data, a variable describes the data within the column (they can often be found the column heading).

Example of a variable:
- Height
- Weight
- Age

Example of a derived variable:
- BMI: calculated from height, weight and age

## Why should we record variable metadata?

Personal benefit
- Overview of your data and what you recorded
- Helpful for your future self to understand your data

Variable metadata search on repositories 
- UK Data Service example
- ICSPR: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/ICPSR/ssvd/
- CLOSER example
  
Encourages cross-study research

---

## Exercise - using variable metadata to search datasets 
- Demonstrate discoverability of data
  
---

## What metadata should you create?

- Variable name - Variable name
- Variable label	- Variable label
- Variable description
- Value representation - Variable structure and content
- Unit of measurement
- Valid range
- Missing values
- Unit type 
- Population
- Source variables

---

## Variable name, label and description

First of all, you need to describe the variable itslef. The variable name, label and description are often the starting point for variable metadata.

| name | label          | description          |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| f_n  | first name     | Full legal first name, no nicknames
| s    | sex            | Self-reported biological sex
| h    | height         | Height calculated to nearest cm
| b_d  | birthdate      | Date of birth yyyy/mm/dd
| m_s  | martial status | Self-reported marital status

- Variable name: the term  used in your dataset e.g. f_n, h, b_d, m_s
- Variable label: A short, clear label describing the variable
- Variable description: A longer explanation of what the variable measures. Sometimes this includes how the variable was collected.

## Value represenation

Next, you need to describe the type of data the variable collects.

| name | label          | description                         |  Value representation          |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| f_n  | first name     | Full legal first name, no nicknames | 
| s    | sex            | Self-reported biological sex
| h    | height         | Height calculated to nearest cm
| b_d  | birthdate      | Date of birth yyyy/mm/dd
| m_s  | martial status | Self-reported marital status

- The value representation of a variable
  - For example: text, numeric, date, code, scale, geographic, image, symbol

-
-
- metadata could define this further: text (conditions/limits), numeric (type), code (codelist)

## Unit type and population
Define what unit type and population are 
Explain why they are important 

---

## You can add more metadata!

We are just covering some basic metadata elements however you can add more elememts depending on what data you need to describe.

---

## How to collect variable metadata
_Suggest tools for collecting this type of metadata_

---

## How can we ensure variable metadata is high quality?
_Recap controlled vocabularies, metadata standards. Interoperability_

---

## What we can do with metadata codebooks

Explain what a codebook is.
Give example of a codebook.
Why codebooks are important.

---

## Practice making variable metadata

[Worked example exercise - give people a dataset and ask them to create the variable metadata]
[Encourage people to make variable metadata for their data]
