## Idenitfying variables

Take a look at this dataset recording data from a survey. What are the variables in this dataset?

| f_n  | h   | b_d        | m_s  | 
|------|-----|------------|------|
| John | 178 | 1998-09-02 | s    |
| Gill | 200 | 1934-06-12 | M    |
| Alice| 182 | 1922-12-24 | M    |

## Idenitfying variables

The variables are:

- f_n
- h
- b_d
- m_s


---

## What are variables?

[discussion question]

---

## Variable definition


:::
notes: CoData doesn't include definition for variable
:::

---

## Why should we record variable metadata?

Personal benefit
Being able to search variable metadata 
- UK Data service example
- CLOSER example
Encourages cross-study research

---

## Exercise - using variable metadata to search datasets 
- Demonstrate discoverability of data
  
---

## What metadata should you create?

- Name - Variable name
- Label	- Variable label
- Value representation - Variable structure and content
- Unit of measurement
- Unit type 
- Population

---

## Variable name and label

| name | label          |
|------|----------------|
| f_n  | first name     | 
| h    | height         | 
| b_d  | birthdate      |
| m_s  | martial status |

- Define what a variable name is 
- Define what a variable name is 

---

## Value represenation

- different types of value representation: text, numeric, code
- metadata could define this further: text (conditions/limits), numeric (type), code (codelist)
  
---

## Unit type and population
Define what unit type and population are 
Explain why they are important 

---

## You can add more metadata!

We are just covering some basic metadata elements however you can add more elememts depending on what data you need to describe.

---

## How to collect variable metadata
_Suggest tools for collecting this type of metadata_

---

## How can we ensure variable metadata is high quality?
_Recap controlled vocabularies, metadata standards. Interoperability_

---

## What we can do with metadata codebooks

Explain what a codebook is.
Give example of a codebook.
Why codebooks are important.

---

## Practice making variable metadata

[Worked example exercise - give people a dataset and ask them to create the variable metadata]
[Encourage people to make variable metadata for their data]
