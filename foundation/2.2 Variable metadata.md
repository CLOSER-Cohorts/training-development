## Idenitfying variables

Take a look at this dataset recording data from a survey. What are the variables in this dataset?

| f_n  | h   | b_d        | m_s  | 
|------|-----|------------|------|
| John | 178 | 1998-09-02 | S    |
| Gill | 200 | 1934-06-12 | M    |
| Alice| 182 | 1922-12-24 | M    |

## Idenitfying variables

The variables are:

- f_n
- h
- b_d
- m_s

## What are variables?

We hear the term variable a lot in research but what do we mean?

>[!NOTE]
> An exercise where people try and identify the features of varaibles

## Variable definition

Variable is a characteristic of a unit being observed. A variable might be the answer of a question, have an administrative source, or be derived from other variables.* 

In rectangular data, a variable describes the data within the column (they can often be found the column heading).

Example of a variable:
- Height
- Weight
- Age

Example of a derived variable:
- BMI: calculated from height, weight and age

:::
*Definition: https://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery.html#variable-and-variable-definition
UK Data Service: definition of a variable - A variable is an attribute that describes a person, place, thing, or idea. The value of the variable can "vary" from one entity to another.
Note: CoData doesn't include definition for variable

## Why should we record variable metadata?

**Personal benefit**

Varibale metadata gives an overview of your data and what you recorded, allowing you to manage your data effectively. It's also helpful for your future self returning to your data, providing a comprehensive overview of what data your research collected.

**Discoverability of data**
Variable metadata can be used by data catalogues and repostiroies to improve search and filter functions. Instead of only being able to discover 
- [UK Data Service variable search tool](https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/variables)
- [ICSPR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/ICPSR/ssvd/)
- [CLOSER variable search tool](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/search/variables)

**Interoperability and (re)usability of data**

By providing variable metadata, people get more detailed information of what data exists in a dataset. Therefore, while a certain variable may not be a focal point for the original research project, another person may use this variable as central focus in secondary research. Moreover, by knowing what variables a research project contains, researchers may be able to cross-study comparisons that they did not know would be possible if they were only working from project or dataset level metadata.

For example, on repositories you can compare variable metadata from different research projects

## Exercise - using variable metadata to search datasets 

>[!NOTE]
> A guided exercise asking people to find the datasets that use a particular varaiable.
> Could also link to a case study of a cross study comparison to show how this functionality allows for further research

---

## What metadata should you create?

We will cover some common variable metadata elements listed below. As we go through each metadata element, you can capture this metadata for the example dataset or your own dataset in the Variable Metadata tab in your excel spreadsheet. 

- Variable name
- Variable label
- Variable description
- Value representation
- Data type
- Unit of measurement
- Valid range
- Missing values
- Unit type 
- Population
- Derived (Y/N)
- Data provenance
- Measurement provenance
- Source reference
- Number of cases
- Valid responses
- Invalid responses

---

## Variable name, label and description

First of all, you need to describe the variable itslef. The variable name, label and description are often the starting point for variable metadata.

**Variable name**
The term  used in your dataset e.g. f_n, h, b_d, m_s

**Variable label**
A short, clear label describing the variable

**Variable description**
A longer explanation of what the variable measures. Sometimes this includes how the variable was collected and what measurement was used. Add enough detail so that someone new to your research could understand.

| Name | Label          | Description          |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| f_n  | first name     | Full legal first name, no nicknames
| s    | sex            | Self-reported biological sex
| h    | height         | Height calculated to nearest cm
| b_d  | birthdate      | Date of birth yyyy/mm/dd
| m_s  | martial status | Self-reported marital status


---

## Value represenation and data type

Next, you need to describe the type of data the variable collects.

**Value representation**
Value representation describes the structure and the content of the variable for example: text, numeric, date, code, scale, geographic, image, symbol

**Data type**

| Name | Label          | Description                         | Value representation | Data type   |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| f_n  | first name     | Full legal first name, no nicknames | text                  |
| s    | sex            | Self-reported biological sex        | code                  |                         
| h    | height         | Height calculated to nearest cm     | numeric               |                        
| b_d  | birthdate      | Date of birth yyyy/mm/dd            | date                  |                           
| m_s  | martial status | Self-reported marital status        | code                  |                           


>[!NOTE]
> Need to be clear here about the difference between value representation and data type
> The input in data type will depend on what is selected in value representation field

## Unit of measurement, valid range and missing values

**Unit of measurement**

**Valid range**

**Missing values**


| name | label          |  Value representation | Data type   | Unit of measurement |  Valid range  |Missing values   |
|------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| f_n  | first name     |                       |             |                    |               |
| s    | sex            |                        
| h    | height         |                         
| b_d  | birthdate      |                           
| m_s  | martial status |

## Unit type, Population and Universe

Now we've describe what the variable is and the data it contains, we need to describe what/who the data is about.

**Unit type**

The unit type is the unit of observation or unit of analysis in your research. It is usually a primary entity, for example: individual, household, establishment, country, dog, apple

**Population**

The Population contextualises the unit type by time and space. It refers to the specific group of individuals or entities from which the data is drawn. Population may include the time or geographical area to which the population is associated.

For example: Adults aged 18-30 in the U.S. as of 2019, Households in urban areas in 2007, All employees in the tech industry in 2012, Dogs in Woof Re-Home Centre during 2016 - 2020

**Universe**

A Universe contextualises a Unit Type by providing additional delimiting characteristics, defining a certain class of entity, people, objects or events. 

Unlike population, Universe has no specification of time and geography, contextualising a Unit Type. While the Population refers to the group actually studied, the Universe is the larger group that the study's conclusions might apply to, based on the sample. For example:
- Persons with a university degree, Retail business establishments

They may also be defined by what it excludes:
- For example: People except those with a university degree

>[!NOTE]
> Should we include Universe here? How much detail should we go into for each one?

## How can we ensure variable metadata is high quality?

>[!NOTE]
> Recap controlled vocabularies, schemas and standards here. OR should we signpost to common CVs as we cover each metadata element.
---

## You can add more metadata!

We are just covering some basic metadata elements however you can add more elememts depending on what data you need to describe.

---

## How to collect variable metadata

You can collect metadata in an excel. However, you may also want to use tools to aid your metadata creation and management.

- [Collectica for Excel](https://www.colectica.com/software/colecticaforexcel/)

>[!NOTE]
> What other useful variable metadata tools should we signpost to?

## Practice creating variable metadata

Going back to the excel metadata template, click onto the variable sheet.
Using this template create metadata for the variables below.

**ADD EXAMPLE VARIABLES HERE**

<details>
<summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p></p>

ADD VARIABLE METADATA HERE SO PEOPLE CAN CHECK THEIR WORK

</details>

>[!NOTE]
> Should we leave the practice activity until the end so participants can see the overview of variable metadata before creating their own with the example variables? Or should we divide this into each section e.g. participants are given these variables from the start and we ask them to create it once we've done the group example.

## Codebooks and data dictionaries 

We touched on codebooks and data dictionaries in the Introduction in unit 2.2.

When you create variable metadata, you can produce a codebook and/or data dictionary for your research.

For more guidance on how to create a codebook or data dictionary, follow these resources:


>[!NOTE]
> Should data dictionaries be included here rather than left to the end? Could explain them here and at the end so they are repeated.
