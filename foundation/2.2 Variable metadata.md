## Metadata for tabular data 

Now we have looked at metadata to describe a research project as a whole, let's take a look at metadata for data (also referred to as low level metadata). This metadata describes what type of data that is included in a dataset. We will be look at quantative, tabular data.

In tabular data, we present data in columns and rows and collect data for different variables. In this unit, we will look at how to create metadata about variables.

First we need to be able to identify what a variable is. 
Take a look at the tabluar dataset. What are the variables in this dataset?

| f_n  | h   | b_d        | m_s  | 
|------|-----|------------|------|
| John | 178 | 1998-09-02 | 3    |
| Gill | 200 | 1934-06-12 | 2    |
| Alice| 182 | 1922-12-24 | 2    |
| Fred | 168 | 2001-05-16 | 1    |
| Laura| 156 | 2011-03-05 | 1    |

<details>
<summary><b>The variables are...</b></summary>
<p></p>

- f_n
- h
- b_d
- m_s

Simply put, variables are the header of the columns in tabular data.

## Defining variables

We use the term variable all the time, but what is it's definition?

>Variable is a characteristic of a unit being observed. A variable might be the answer of a question, have an administrative source, or be derived from other variables.* 

Examples of a variable could be ...
- Height
- Weight
- Age

You can also derive data from other variable data. For example BMI is a derived variable, calculated from the variables height, weight and age.

:::
*Definition: https://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/discovery.html#variable-and-variable-definition
UK Data Service: definition of a variable - A variable is an attribute that describes a person, place, thing, or idea. The value of the variable can "vary" from one entity to another.
Note: CoData doesn't include definition for variable - will be in new terminology bank

## Why create variable metadata?

Thinking back to the tabular dataset example, if you asked someone what their dataset contains and they sent you the following...

>The dataset contains the variables:
>- f_n
>- h
>- b_d
>- m_s

Would you have the information required to understand the dataset and assess whether it is relevant to you?
<p></p>
Similarly, imagine you are coming back to a dataset you created 10 years ago. Would remember what the variabels f_n; h; b_d; m_s mean?
<p></p>
What information would you need in order to be able to understand the dataset and its variables?
<p></p>
<details>
<summary><b> Variable metadata</b></summary>
<p></p>

In order to understand the variables, you will probably need information for the following questions...

- What do the abbreviations mean?
- What type of data did you collect for the variable?
- How was the variable measured?
- How was the variable data collected?
- What was the unit of study?
- How much data was collected for each data?
- What are the valid inputs for the variable data?

Variable metadata provdes the information to answer these questions. 

</details>

If we didn't have information about the variables, we would have to undertake time consuming processes decode what variables mean and what type of data they collected. If it is our own data, this may include working back through legacy files to remember how the research was conducted. If it is other people's data or an external person is trying to understand our datasets, they would have to contact the data creator in order to clarify what the variables mean and the type of data. If trustworthy information about the variables cannot be located, that would hinder the reliability of the dataset and make it less likely to be re-used.

What are the benefits of variable metadata?

<details>
<summary><b> Benefits of variable metadata</b></summary>
<p></p>

**Personal benefit**
By having a clear record of what variable abbreviations mean and the type of data collected, metadata allows you to manage your data during the research process. It also helps for your future self when you return to your data, allowing you to quickly understand a dataset and potentially re-use it. 

**Re-usability of data**
With variable metadata, people get a broader and more comprehensive picture of what data exists in a dataset. So even if a variable is not a focal point of the original research project or publication, another person may find this variable and re-use the variable data in their secondary research. Moreover, by knowing what variables a research project contains, researchers may be able to cross-study comparisons that they did not know would be possible if they were only working from high level metadata.

If you're sharing your (meta)data, variable metadata can also help the **discoverability of data**
Variable metadata is sometimes used by data catalogues as part of their search and filter functions. For example ...
- [UK Data Service variable search tool](https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/variables)
- [ICSPR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/ICPSR/ssvd/)
- [CLOSER variable search tool](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/search/variables)

They also provide information about the variables directly on these sites, allowning people to interact with variable metadata in a straightforward way.

## What metadata should you create?

Thinking back to the type of information we would need to understand the variabale and the dataset, what metadata elements could we capture to provide 

**What do the abbreviations mean?**
<details>
<summary>Metadata elements</summary>
<p></p>
  - Variable name
  - Variable label
  - Variable description
</details>

<p></p>

**What type of data did you collect for the variable?**
<details>
<summary>Metadata elements</summary>
<p></p>
  - Value representation
  - Data type
  - Valid inputs
</details>

<p></p>

**How was the variable measured?**
<details>
<summary>Metadata elements</summary>
<p></p>
  - Unit of measurement
  - Derived Y/N
  - Data provenance
  - Measurement provenance
  - Source reference
</details>

<p></p>  

**What was the unit of study?**
<details>
<summary>Metadata elements</summary>
<p></p>
  - Unit type
  - Population
  - Universe
</details>

<p></p>

**How much data was collected for each data?**
<details>
<summary>Metadata elements</summary>
<p></p>
  - Number of cases
  - Missing value code
  - Valid responses

</details>

<p></p>


In the rest of this unit, we shall go through these metadata elements and look at how we can capture information for each. As we go through each metadata element, you can practice capturing variable metadata in the Variable Metadata tab of the Metadata Template excel. You can use your own dataset or the example dataset in the unit.

## Variable name, label and description

First of all, you need to describe the variable itslef. The variable name, label and description are often the starting point for variable metadata.

**Variable name**
This is the term used for the variable in your dataset e.g. f_n, h, b_d, m_s

**Variable label**
A short, clear label describing the variable, explaining any abbreviations in the variable name e.g. f_n = first name

**Variable description**
A longer explanation of what the variable measures. Sometimes this includes how the variable was collected and what measurement was used. Add enough detail so that someone new to your research could understand.

| Name | Label          | Description          |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| f_n  | first name     | Full legal first name, no nicknames
| s    | sex            | Self-reported biological sex
| h    | height         | Height calculated to nearest cm
| b_d  | birthdate      | Date of birth yyyy/mm/dd
| m_s  | martial status | Self-reported marital status


---

## Value representation and data type

Next, you need to describe the type of data collected for the variable.

**Value representation**
Value representation describes the structure and the content of the data variable for example: text, numeric, date, code, scale, geographic, image, symbol

**Data type**
Data type provides further information about this data. For example, in for variable 'Sex' it's value representation is a code list. However, as we can see in the dataset above, the codes are presented as numbers 1, 2, 3. This means the data type would be numeric.


| Name | Label          | Description                         | Value representation | Data type   |
|------|----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| f_n  | first name     | Full legal first name, no nicknames | text                 | string
| s    | sex            | Self-reported biological sex        | code                 | numeric                        
| h    | height         | Height calculated to nearest cm     | numeric              | postive interger                       
| b_d  | birthdate      | Date of birth yyyy/mm/dd            | date                 | date                          
| m_s  | martial status | Self-reported marital status        | code                 | numeric

> Need to check what data type is here

## Unit of measurement, valid range and missing values

Once you have describe the data as it appears in the dataset, it's important to include extra contextual information so you can interpret that data further and gain meaningful information.

For example, for height, we know the the data is numeric. However, we don't know if these numbers indicate metres, centimeters or millimeters. We need infomration around the the unit of measurement, what valid ranges are accepted, and identify the code for missing values.

**Unit of measurement**
The unit of measurement is simply the . Some variables will not need a

**Valid range**

**Missing value code**


| name | label          |  Value representation | Data type   | Unit of measurement | Valid range   |Missing value code  |
|------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| f_n  | first name     |                       |             |                     |               |
| s    | sex            |                        
| h    | height         |                         
| b_d  | birthdate      |                           
| m_s  | martial status |

## Unit type, Population and Universe

Now we've describe what the variable is and the data it contains, we need to describe what/who the data is about.

**Unit type**

The unit type is the unit of observation or unit of analysis in your research. It is usually a primary entity, for example: individual, household, establishment, country, dog, apple

**Population**

The Population contextualises the unit type by time and space. It refers to the specific group of individuals or entities from which the data is drawn. Population may include the time or geographical area to which the population is associated.

For example: Adults aged 18-30 in the U.S. as of 2019, Households in urban areas in 2007, All employees in the tech industry in 2012, Dogs in Woof Re-Home Centre during 2016 - 2020

**Universe**

A Universe contextualises a Unit Type by providing additional delimiting characteristics, defining a certain class of entity, people, objects or events. 

Unlike population, Universe has no specification of time and geography, contextualising a Unit Type. While the Population refers to the group actually studied, the Universe is the larger group that the study's conclusions might apply to, based on the sample. For example:
- Persons with a university degree, Retail business establishments

They may also be defined by what it excludes:
- For example: People except those with a university degree

>[!NOTE]
> Should we include Universe here? How much detail should we go into for each one?
> Universe not having a time & geography is slightly confusing, because it is a universe WITHIN a population, so it inherits
> JJ A good example using Undestanding Society could be
> Unit Type == Households,
> Population == "probability sample of approx. 24,000 households in Great Britain in 2009-10",
> Universe == "questions asked to those in work".
> This means that you can compare between different populations and time by the characteristics defined by the population e.g. Those in work in USOC with those in work in the Census

## How can we ensure variable metadata is high quality?

Thinking back to the Introduction unit, how can we make sure variable metadata is high quality.


---

## You can add more metadata!

We are just covering some basic metadata elements however you can add more elememts depending on what data you need to describe.

---

## How to collect variable metadata

You can collect metadata in an excel. However, you may also want to use tools to aid your metadata creation and management. For example [Collectica for Excel](https://www.colectica.com/software/colecticaforexcel/) allows you to create metadata
