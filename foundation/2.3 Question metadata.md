## Metadata for data collection instruments

How might data be collected?




You may collect data through questionnaires and surveys. It is important to document these questions so your metadata effectively captures the research process and details how you produced your data. This builds strong data provenance enhancing the trustworthiness of your data, preserving it for future reference and re-use.

In this unit we will look at common metadata elements captured for questions.

## Question metadata

What information might we want to record about a questionnaire?

Common question metadata elements

- Question name (R)
- Question label (R)
- Question text (R)
- Question instruction (O)
- Response domain (R)


>[!NOTE]
> Inlcude here the different ways questionnaires (e.g. CAPI, hard copy etc.) can be administered and how this will change the metadata creation approach.

## Creating question metadata

Let's try creating metadata for this questionnaire.

First we need to describe the question itself. This includes capturing the question text and instruction as they appear on the origianl questionnaire document.

**Question label**
The question label is the unique code assigned to a question the researcher which does not contain any spaces and is machine readable. This can follow whatever logical format the research determines, though its important that the question label is unique.

**Question name**
The question name is similar to the a question label but is a human readable title or tag used to identify the question. Sometimes this tag is included in the original questionnaire file, for example in the questionnaire above they list the questions numerically, so we can use those numbers for the question names. You may also need to create question names for questions. Again, the format can follow a logical structure determined by the researcher but it is important that each question has a unique name in order to avoid confusion.

**Question text**
The question as written on the original questionnaire. Note, it's important when capturing metadata that you don't look to correct any identifier mistakes in the original research materials, for example correcting a spelling or grammatical error in a question when capturing the metadata for the question text. It's important describe the data and the data collection instruments as fully as possible.

**Question instruction**
Sometimes a question is accompanied by a further instruction. For example, for question 11, there could be the further instruction 'Please exclude time watching videos on computers.'. In this scenario, the sentence is not part of the original question but provides further guidance and direction for the answer the participant will record. This means we would capture this in the 'Question instruction' rather than 'Question text',.
  

| Question name | Question label          | Question text              |  Question instruction              |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
|               |                         |                            |                                    |
|               |                         |                            |                                    |
|               |                         |                            |                                    |

## Response domain

Response domain defines the allowable set of answers or response options for a given question. It establishes the range or boundaries of valid responses, which can be either fixed or variable depending on the type of question. 

Types of response domains:
- Codelist
- Numeric
- Text
- Date/time
- Scale

| Question name | Question label          | Question text              |  Question instruction              | Response Domain             |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|               |                         |                            |                                    |
|               |                         |                            |                                    |
|               |                         |                            |                                    |
