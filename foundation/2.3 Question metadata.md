## Metadata for data collection instruments

In the previous unit, we looked at metadata to describe the dataset and the actual data within the dataset. In this unit, we will create metadata to describe how that data was collected.

How might data be collected?

- Questionnaires or surveys (either online Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) questionnaires or hard-copy paper questionnaires)
- Interviews or focus groups
- Observation using measurement tool e.g. thermometer, tape measure (cm), scales, microscope
- Approximation

It is useful to capture metadata about these data collection instruments so we can further contextualise the data. This serves as a useful reminder to how your research is conducted as well as help others interacting with your data assess the relevance and reliability of that data for their needs.

for example, if we record the model of the microscope, we know the specifications and functionalities of the tool that the researcher used to collect the data which allows us to further contextualise the research. For interviews, you may want to record who the interviewer was and where it was held (e.g. online, in-person etc.).

In this unit, we will explore core metadata elements to help describe questionnaires and surveys.

## Metadata for questionnaires

 It is important to document these questions so your metadata effectively captures the research process and details how you produced your data. This builds strong data provenance enhancing the trustworthiness of your data, preserving it for future reference and re-use.

In this unit we will look at common metadata elements captured for questions.

What information might we want to record about a questionnaire?

In this unit, we will explore common question metadata elements, including ...

- Question name (R)
- Question label (R)
- Question text (R)
- Question instruction (O)
- Response domain (R)

They way that this metadata is collected will depend on how a questionnaire is administered. For example, if you are using online software to develop and deliver a questionnaire (CAPI questionnaire), you may be able to pull the metadata the directly from the online software, saving you time in your metadata creation. However, if a questionnaire is administered as a hard copy, you would need to interpret the paper form that has been developed and create metadata from scratch.

## Creating question metadata

Let's try creating metadata for this questionnaire.

First we need to describe the question itself. This includes capturing the question text and instruction as they appear on the origianl questionnaire document.

**Question label**<br>
The question label is the unique code assigned to a question the researcher which does not contain any spaces and is machine readable. This can follow whatever logical format the research determines, though its important that the question label is unique.

**Question name**<br>
The question name is similar to the a question label but is a human readable title or tag used to identify the question. Sometimes this tag is included in the original questionnaire file, for example in the questionnaire above they list the questions numerically, so we can use those numbers for the question names. You may also need to create question names for questions. Again, the format can follow a logical structure determined by the researcher but it is important that each question has a unique name in order to avoid confusion.

**Question text**<br>
The question as written on the original questionnaire. Note, it's important when capturing metadata that you don't look to correct any identifier mistakes in the original research materials, for example correcting a spelling or grammatical error in a question when capturing the metadata for the question text. It's important describe the data and the data collection instruments as fully as possible.

**Question instruction**<br>
Sometimes a question is accompanied by a further instruction. For example, for question 11, there could be the further instruction 'Please exclude time watching videos on computers.'. In this scenario, the sentence is not part of the original question but provides further guidance and direction for the answer the participant will record. This means we would capture this in the 'Question instruction' rather than 'Question text',.
  

| Question name | Question name |Question text          |  Question instruction              
|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------
| Q_11          | 11            | How many hours do you spend watching TV, including video and DVDs, on a normal school day? |-                                    |
| Q_12          | 12            |Do you have your own personal mobile phone? |-                                    |
| Q_13          | 13            |How many close friends do you have – friends you could talk to if you were in some kind of trouble? | -                                   |

## Response domain

In questionnaires and surveys, respondents answer questions in different ways. They might select answers from a predefined options or there might be a free text field.  

Response domain metadata defines _how_ someone can answer a question. It establishes the range or boundaries of valid responses, which can be either fixed or variable depending on the type of question. 

The different of response domains are ...

- **Codelist**
  - When respondents choose from predefined set of answers, this is called a codelist. You may want to give further information about a codelist to say whether respondents can only select a single option (code) or whether they can select multiple options.
  
- **Numeric**
  - Answers are recorded in numeric format. You could define the allowable value further by specifying whether the answer field accepts decimal places or only numbers within a certain range, for example.
    
- **Text**
  - Answers are recorded in text format. You could define this further by specifying if there is word limit.
    
- **Date/time**
  - Answers are recorded as date/time. If the questionnaire controls how the date and/or time are recorded, you might also want to include that in your metadata. For example, if time has to be recorded in digital format or if respondents are asked to record a date in DD/MM/YYYY format.
   
- **Scale**
  -

| Question name | Question name |Question text          |  Question instruction      | Response Domain            |          
|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Q_11          | 11            | How many hours do you spend watching TV, including video and DVDs, on a normal school day? |-  |Code list  |
| Q_12          | 12            |Do you have your own personal mobile phone? |-  |Code list  |
| Q_13          | 13            |How many close friends do you have – friends you could talk to if you were in some kind of trouble? | -  |Numeric  |


Why is having response domain metadata important?

If you only had access to the above metadata and not the original questionnaire, what additional information might you need to understand what the questionnaire contains?

For codelists, we would want to know what codes were used. For example, for Q_11 in the questionnaire screenshot, you could have a code list with the following codes ...

- <1 hours
- 1-2 hours
- 3-4 hours
- 4-5 hours
- 6-7 hours
- 8-9 hours
- 10+ hours

or it could have the codes as stated above ...

- None
- Less than an hour
- 1-3 hours
- 4-6 hours
- 7 hours +

To record information about codelists, we want to capture code and category metadata. We will look at this metadata in more detail in the next unit 2.4.

## Deciphering response domains

**Example 1**<br>

What response domain type do you think the following the question is? (codelist / scale)

How satisfied are you with the customer service you received? Select the following...

1 - Very Dissatisfied
2 - Dissatisfied
3 - Neutral
4 - Satisfied
5 - Very Satisfied

**Example 2**<br>

What response domain type do you think the following the question is? (numeric / scale)
