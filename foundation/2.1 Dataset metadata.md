## Dataset metadata
 
Like the project metadata we explored in the previous , dataset metadata provides the what, when, why, where and how of a particular dataset. For larger research projects, you may produce multiple datasets. These datasets could be have a more specific focus within the research project or be carried out in a specific location or by a particular researcher. As such, the metadata for each dataset will vary and it will differ from the project metadata.

**What metadata elements that we captured at the project level that we would also want to capture at the dataset level?**

<details>
<summary>Repeated metadata elements to capture for datasets</summary>

- **Title**
  - the title of the dataset
- **Creator**
  - the creator of the particular dataset
- **Subject**
  - e.g. keywords or topics
- **Description**
  - e.g. a description of the dataset and what it includes
- **Contributor**
  - e.g. people or organisations who contributed to the research process
- **Date**
  - e.g. the date range of when the data for that dataset was collected
- **Type**
- **Format**
  - the format that the dataset is stored in
- **Language**
  - the language the dataset is stored in

**What additional metadata elements should we collect for a dataset?**

<details>
<summary>New metadata elements to capture for datasets</summary>
<p></p>

- **Project**
  - the project that produced the dataset
- **Case quantity**
  - how many cases are included in the file
- **Variables**
  - how many variables are included in the file
- **Last Updated**
  - when the dataset was last updated

</details>

>[!NOTE]
>Would the last couple around variables classify as variable metadata rather than dataset metadata?
