----
We need to describe what/who the data is about. We can do this by capturing Unit Type, Universe and Population metadata.

Populations are collections of Unit Types at a specific time and geography
Universes are sub-sets of Unit Types which are agnostic to its time and place

The reason for being explicit about these terms is that they provide a way to understand 
Who or what is being measured
Where and when is was being measured
The characteristic is whom or what is being measured

This can seem self evident but if we want to validly combine or compare data (or at least know we are NOT comparing the same thing) these are important peices of metadata whihc allow us to make valid or informed decisions.

### Exercise

#### Measuring Income at the same time and geography

| Type        | Example 1                      | Example 2                         | Example 3                                   |
|-------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Unit Type   | Individual | Household | Business |
| Population  | All persons in England in 2021 | All households in England in 2021 | All registered businesses in England in 2021 |
| Universe    | Income of > £1 million per year | Income of > £1 million per year | Income of > £1 million per year |

#### Measuring Income at a different time 

| Type        | Example 1                      | Example 2                         | 
|-------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Unit Type   | Individual | Individual |
| Population  | All persons in England in 2021  | All persons in England in 2011 |
| Universe    | Income of > £1 million per year | Income of > £1 million per year |

#### Measuring Income at a different geographical area

| Type        | Example 1                      | Example 2                         | 
|-------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Unit Type   | Individual | Individual |
| Population  | All persons in England in 2021  | All persons in Wales in 2021 |
| Universe    | Income of > £1 million per year | Income of > £1 million per year |

#### Measuring Income for different universes

| Type        | Example 1                      | Example 2                         | 
|-------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Unit Type   | Individual | Individual |
| Population  | All persons in England in 2021  | All persons in England in 2021 |
| Universe    | Over 67 years of age | 16-67 years of age |

>[!NOTE]
>SW This section confuses me a bit - are 'unit type' and 'universe' widely used terms in metadata? If we are planning to keep these terms in, I think a simple graphic of how they all fit together (unit type, population and universe), to accompany the text, would be really useful here. As I was reading through this, I found myself thinking that, as a researcher, I would generally describe lot of these things as psrt of the 'population'. <br>
> KR When discussing with JJ, unit type/population/universe are key metadata concepts to explain. That's useful to know - I will try and create a infographic that describes their relationship to each other.

Now we've described the variable and type of data it contains, we need to describe what/who the data is about. We can do this by capturing Unit Type, Universe and Population metadata.

**Unit type**

The Unit Type is the unit of observation or analysis in your research based on a single characteristic, with no specification of time and geography. It is usually a primary entity, for example: individual, household, establishment, country, dog, apple.

For the example dataset, we are collecting the name, height, birthdate, sex, martial status of an <mark>individual</mark>

The Universe and Population help contextualise the Unit Type further, however they do so in different ways.

**Universe**

A Universe contextualises a Unit Type by providing additional characteristics, defining a certain group of people, objects, institutions or events. 

For example...
- Individuals with a university degree
- Individuals with an employment contract for a tech company
- Retail business establishments

In this way, the Universe is the larger group that the study's conclusions might apply to, based on the sample. However, while the Universe details further characteristics, it does not contextualise the Unit Type by georgaphy or time. 

>[!NOTE]
> BO - I feel like the universise is the smaller group as you're narrowing down which kinds of people i.e. not just ALL individuals, just those who work for tech companies. What do you think? 

For the example dataset, if the data was only collected for adults aged 18-50, the Universe would be individuals aged 18-50. This means we could compare Universe metadata from studies conducted at different times and/or locations so you can compare trends observed for adults aged 18-50.

A Universe may also be defined by what it excludes...<br>
- People except those with a university degree
- Dogs without an owner

**Population**<br>
The Population contextualises the Unit Type by specifying **time and geography**. It refers to the specific group of individuals or entities from which the data is collected. 

So if the Unit Type is individuals, the **Population** could be individuals **living in the UK as of 2016**. So while Unit Type applies to all time periods and locations, Population specifies these details.

For example: 
- Households <mark>in urban areas in 2007</mark>
- All <mark>employees in the tech industry in 2012</mark>
- Dogs <mark>in Woof Re-Home Centre during 2016 - 2020</mark>

In the example dataset above, we would put the following ...

| name | label          | Unit Type                 |  Population                                    |Universe                      |
|------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| f_n  | first name     | Individual                | Adults aged 18-50 living in the UK as of 2016  | Adults aged 18-50
| s    | sex            | Individual                | Adults aged 18-50 living in the UK as of 2016  | Adults aged 18-50
| h    | height         | Individual                | Adults aged 18-50 living in the UK as of 2016  | Adults aged 18-50
| b_d  | birthdate      | Individual                | Adults aged 18-50 living in the UK as of 2016  | Adults aged 18-50
| m_s  | martial status | Individual                | Adults aged 18-50 living in the UK as of 2016  | Adults aged 18-50

As these variables are from a single data collection point, the Unit Type, Population and Universe will be the same. If your whole dataset only collects data from a single source, then it may be more efficient to capture the Unit Type, Population and Universe metadata at the dataset level so you don't have to repeat it in your variable metadata.

However, if your dataset compiled data from different sources and/or on different levels, you would need to specify the different Unit Type, Population and Universe for each variable.

For example, let's look at this example dataset collecting data on crop health. 

The data was collected in 2024 in England.

| Sample ID | Crop   | Date Collected | Field ID | NDVI Score | Disease Present | Farm ID | Farm Size (ha) | Region    | Avg. Rainfall (mm) | Avg. Temp (°C) |
| --------- | ------ | -------------- | ---------| ----------- | -------------- | --------|-------------|---------------| -------------------| -------------- 
| S001      | Wheat  | 2025-06-12     | F-EM01   | 0.78        | No             | Farm01  | 120         | East midlands | 55.2               | 19.1           |

| S003      | Corn   | 2025-06-14     | F-SE03   | 0.82        | No             | Farm03  | 180         | South west    | 48.6               | 22.3           |
| S004      | Wheat  | 2025-06-15     | F-WM04   | 0.73        | No             | Farm01  | 120         | West midlands | 55.2               | 19.1           |

<summary>What are the benefits of including Unit Type, Universe and Population metadata?</summary>
<p></p>

First, it gives us a clear picture of what/who the data is about and what the unit of analysis is for a variable.

Moreover, as Unit Type and Universe are not defined by time or geography, you open up the possibility of that varaiable being compared with other similar variables from different datasets conducted at a different time and/or place. This encourages cross-study comparison, fuelling the potential for new research investigations from existing data.
