1.1	Why create metadata?

•	New
•	Overall reasons (see 1.1). Lets look at how creating metadata could – i make data management processes more robust and efficient, ii enable more accurate, reliable and higher-quality research, iii help your future self (and others)   understand and reuse the data (need to demonstrate this in this section (or wider in the foundation?), the other points are more self-explanatory, but it would be good if we can genuinely show this)). 
•	To start, we will look through a hypothetical example dataset, where the instrument of data collection is a questionnaire, and which could have been implemented as part of a student project. The following units will then take a more detailed look into some of terms highlighted related to creating research metadata.

•	Think about what research questions might have been asked/what research questions could be asked from this data? What variables might you want to compare or not, how would you make these decisions?
•	In order to decide, you might think about - What is the variable about? How was it measured? What is being measured? Any transformation needed (e.g. converting from ounces into grams or recoding etc.)
•	Intuitively (from skills acquired/training) know what to look for about the variables. Now how do we capture this information and what terms might we use? Some of these have been covered in the intro and will be recapped here, some are new.
•	…Basic definitions of universe, concept etc…. 
•	…Reasons and examples of why you might want to document these…
