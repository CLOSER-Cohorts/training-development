title: Unit 1.2 What metadata to creat

## What metadata should I create?

There is a vast range of metadata you could potentially capture and there are many different ways you create and manage this metadata.

While more metadata makes your data more discoverable, understandable and (re)usable, the amount of metadata it is a trade-off between time and resource.

It's important that you create the right metadata for your research, addressing your research aims, scope and needs.

How should you decide what metadata to create?

## How to decide what metadata to create?

There is no singular, universally-agreed set of minimum metadata standards. If you look on the internet, there are a variety of suggestions as to what should be required as a minimum set of metadata.

While there is not one standard, there are common metadata elements that are often seen as fundamental metadata to create. This is usually study level metadata: the who, what, where, when and how of the research. How you document these metadata elements may be defined further if you are using a particular metadata standard and/or controlled vocabulary.

Beyond this set of core metadata, what metadata you create depends on your individual project. When deciding what metadata to create, you should consider:

- Scope and aim of research
  - Is it a one-off study or a repeated study?
  - How many people will you share you data with? Is it an independent project for personal reference or will you make your data discoverable and available to others? If you're making your data discoverable to others, how widely do you want to share it? (note, this does not mean the data has to be open)
    
- Resources and time
  
- Discipline and research field
  - What are the common standards and requirements in your discipline
    
- Repository requirements

## Independent one-off study

If you're doing a one-off individual research project for personal use, you could choose what metadata to capture yourself.

However, it is important to plan your metadata creation and management thoroughly. 
If you don't plan, you may come across these challenges:
- Metadata creation becomes time consuming
- Metadata is unique to this singular project reducing its reusability in other research projects you do in the future or it's interoperability if you decide to share your metadata in the future
    - There's room for human error
   
- In this unit, we will look at some common metadata elements at dataset, variable and question level in order to help simplify this process and help identify minimum about of metadata to create.

## Using metadata tools to decide
Using tools such metadata cataologues, schemas and standards can help define what metadata elements to create, saving you time.

---

## Metadata catalogues

Sometimes catalogues give advice as to what metadata to create.

For example, the [CESSDA Metadata model](https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Resource-crd-2592) gives a alist of metadata elements marking them mandatory, recommended and optional. It gives a description of each element as well as recommended controlled vocabularies.

## Metadata schemas

_Define metadata schemas_

_Outline cross disciplinary and dsicpline specific schemas_

## Metadata schemas and metadata creation

Metadata schemas:
- Define what metadata elements to create
- Also define input for different metadata elements

Benefits:
- Saves you time deciding what metadata elements to create
- FAIR principles

## Common metadata standards

Arts & Humanities
- Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA): CDWA is a standard for the description of art, architecture, and other cultural works.
- Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO): CCO is a guide containing value standards for the description of art, architecture, archaeological artifacts, and other types of material culture.
- Text Encoding Initiative (TEI): TEI is most commonly used for literary texts or manuscripts in the field of digital humanities.

Library & Information Science
- Online Information Exchange (ONIX) for Books: ONIX is an international standard for representing and communicating book industry product information
- PBCore: PBCore is a metadata schema designed for sound and moving images.
- Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS): PREMIS is used for creating preservation metadata for digital objects.

Physical & Life Sciences
- Crystallographic Information Framework/File (CIF): CIF is a standard for archiving and reporting crystal structure data.
- Darwin Core (DWC): Darwin Core is an extension of Dublin Core for biological diversity data.
- Ecological Metadata Language (EML): EML a standard for the earth, environmental, and ecological sciences.
- Flexible Image Transport System (FITS): FITS is a standard used for astronomy image data.
- NeXus: NeXus is an international standard for neutron, x-ray, and muon experiment data.
- ISO 19115: ISO 19115 is an international standard for describing geographic information.
- OpenGeoMetadata (OGM) Aardvark Schema: OpenGeoMetadata (OGM) is a metadata schema for geospatial resources.

Social & Behavioral Sciences
- Data Documentation Initiative (DDI): DDI is an international standard for describing social science datasets which includes a metadata specification, controlled vocabularies, and tools for working with DDI metadata.
- Friend of a Friend (FOAF): FOAF is a standard for social media and is focused on the relationships that connect people, places, and things described on the web.

## How to use metadata schemas and standards

If you are conducting an individual project you may not have the time or resource to use a full metadata standard or schema.

However, you can look at the metadata elements they require and the controlled vocabularies they prescribe in order to make sure you
