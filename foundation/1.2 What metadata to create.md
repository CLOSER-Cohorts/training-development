author: 
date: April 29, 2025
---
## What metadata should I create?
- There are many different ways and types of metadata you can create, how should you decide?

---

## Individual to each research project

- Scope and aim of research
- Discipline

---

## Independent assessment

- If you're doing an individual research project for personal use, you could decide what metadata elements to capture yourself.
  - Potential drawbacks
    - Time consuming
    - Reduces interoperability and reusability
    - More room for human error
   
- In this unit, we will look at some common metadata elements at dataset, variable and question level in order to help simplify this process and help identify minimum about of metadata to create.

## Using metadata tools to decide
Using tools such metadata cataologues, schemas and standards can help define what metadata elements to create, saving you time.

---

## Metadata catalogues

Sometimes catalogues give advice as to what metadata to create.

For example, the [CESSDA Metadata model](https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Resource-crd-2592) gives a alist of metadata elements marking them mandatory, recommended and optional.

_Define metadata schemas_

_Outline cross disciplinary and dsicpline specific schemas_

## Metadata schemas and metadata creation

Metadata schemas:
- Define what metadata elements to create
- Also define input for different metadata elements

Benefits:
- Saves you time deciding what metadata elements to create
- FAIR principles

## Common metadata standards

- PBCore: PBCore is a metadata schema designed for sound and moving images.
- Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS): PREMIS is used for creating preservation metadata for digital objects.

Physical & Life Sciences
- Crystallographic Information Framework/File (CIF): CIF is a standard for archiving and reporting crystal structure data.
- Darwin Core (DWC): Darwin Core is an extension of Dublin Core for biological diversity data.
- Ecological Metadata Language (EML): EML a standard for the earth, environmental, and ecological sciences.
- Flexible Image Transport System (FITS): FITS is a standard used for astronomy image data.

- ISO 19115: ISO 19115 is an international standard for describing geographic information.
- OpenGeoMetadata (OGM) Aardvark Schema: OpenGeoMetadata (OGM) is a metadata schema for geospatial resources.

Social & Behavioral Sciences
- Data Documentation Initiative (DDI): DDI is an international standard for describing social science datasets which includes a metadata specification, controlled vocabularies, and tools for working with DDI metadata.
- Friend of a Friend (FOAF): FOAF is a standard for social media and is focused on the relationships that connect people, places, and things described on the web.

## How to use metadata schemas and standards

If you are conducting an individual project you may not have the time or resource to use a full metadata standard or schema.

However, you can look at the metadata elements they require and the controlled vocabularies they prescribe in order to make sure you
