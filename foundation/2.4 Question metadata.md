## Metadata for data collection instruments

In the previous unit, we looked at metadata to describe the characteristics of the data within the dataset. Next, we will create metadata to describe how that data was collected.

**How might data be collected?**

- Questionnaires or surveys (either online Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) questionnaires or hard-copy paper questionnaires)
- Interviews or focus groups
- Observation using measurement tools e.g. thermometer, tape measure (cm), scales, microscope
- Experiment

It is useful to capture metadata about the method of data collection so we can further contextualise the data and build its provenance. This metadata serves as a useful reminder for yourself on how the research was conducted, as well as helping others understand your data and assess its reliability. As such, it enhances the trustworthiness of your data and transparency of your research process, preserving your data for future reference and re-use.

For example...
- If we record the model of the microscope, we know the specifications and functionalities of the tool that the researcher used to collect the data which will impact the type and specifity of the data collected
- For interviews, it's useful to know who the interviewer was and where it was held (e.g. online, in-person etc.)
- If a questionnaire is being used, it's important to know whether it was administered as a hard copy or online. Written questionnaires may contain more human errors whereas online questionnaires (CAPIs) are less likely to have these same errors

In this unit, we will explore core metadata elements to document questionnaires and surveys.

## Metadata for questionnaires

What information might we want to record about a questionnaire?

The elements marked with (R) should be considered required metadata that all projects complete. The elements marked with (O) are optional metadata that can be completed if relevant and necessary.

**What was the question?**

They way questionnaire metadata is created will depend on how the questionnaire is administered. For example, if you use an online software to deliver a questionnaire (CAPI questionnaire), you could use the software to help automate the metadata creation for both the questionnaire and the variables, saving you time and resources. However, if a questionnaire is administered as a hard copy, you would need to interpret the paper form and create metadata from scratch.

## Creating question metadata

Let's try creating metadata for this questionnaire.

<img src="img/Self-completion questionnaire (10 - 15 yrs).png" alt="Alt Text" width="425" height="900"> 

First, we need to describe the question itself. This includes capturing the question text and instruction as they appear on the origianl questionnaire document.

**Question label**<br>
The question label is the unique code assigned to a question which does not contain any spaces and is machine readable. This can follow whatever logical format the researcher determines, though its important that the question label is unique.

**Question name**<br>
The question name is similar to the a question label but is a human readable tag used to identify a question. Sometimes this tag is included in the original questionnaire file. For example, in the questionnaire above, they list the questions numerically, so we can use those numbers as the question names. You can also create question names if they're not available in the questionnaire. The format should follow a logical structure with a unique name for each question in order to avoid confusion.

**Question text**<br>
The question as written on the original questionnaire. Note, it's important when capturing question text metadata that you don't correct any mistakes in the original research materials, such as a spelling or grammatical errors, as you want to ensure your metadata is as accurate as possible.

**Question instruction**<br>
Sometimes a question is accompanied by a further instruction. For example, for question 11, there could be the further instruction 'Please exclude time watching videos on computers.'. In this scenario, the sentence is not part of the original question but provides further direction on the answer the participant will record, so we would capture this in the 'Question instruction' rather than the 'Question text'.
  

| Question label | Question name |Question text          |  Question instruction              
|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------
| Q_11          | 11            | How many hours do you spend watching TV, including video and DVDs, on a normal school day? |-                                    |
| Q_12          | 12            |Do you have your own personal mobile phone? |-                                    |
| Q_13          | 13            |How many close friends do you have – friends you could talk to if you were in some kind of trouble? | -                                   |

>[!NOTE]
> BO - I think at a later stage we could slim down this unit/course, not in terms of the content, but making it a bit more punchy like the Intro course :)

## Response domain

In questionnaires and surveys, respondents answer questions in different ways. They might select answers from predefined options or there might be a free text field.  

Response domain metadata defines _how_ someone can answer a question. It establishes the range or boundaries of valid responses, which can be either fixed or variable depending on the type of question. 

The different of response domains are ...

- **Codelist**
  - When respondents choose from a predefined set of answers, this is called a codelist. A codelist is made up of a set of categories that are represented by a code (we will delive deeper into codes and categories in the next unit). 
  
- **Numeric**
  - Answers are recorded in numeric format. You could define the allowable value further by specifying whether the answer field accepts decimal places or only numbers within a certain range, for example.
    
- **Text**
  - Answers are recorded in text format. You could define this further by specifying if there is word limit.
    
- **Date/time**
  - Answers are recorded as date/time. If the questionnaire controls how the date and/or time are recorded, you might also want to include that in your metadata. For example, if time has to be recorded in digital format or if respondents are asked to record a date in DD/MM/YYYY format.
   
- **Scale**
>[!NOTE] on CLOSER we have listed the response domain for [this question](https://discovery.closer.ac.uk/item/uk.genscot/09b45dcd-671b-47b9-bcc9-6d809302bc30) as code list. However, could it be used here as an example of a Scale?
>BO - Agreed

| Question label | Question name |Question text          |  Question instruction      | Response Domain            |          
|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Q_11          | 11            | How many hours do you spend watching TV, including video and DVDs, on a normal school day? |-  |Code list  |
| Q_12          | 12            | Do you have your own personal mobile phone? |-  |Code list  |
| Q_13          | 13            | How many close friends do you have – friends you could talk to if you were in some kind of trouble? | -  |Numeric  |


If you only had access to the above metadata and not the original questionnaire, what additional information might you need to understand the question and the data it would collect?

<details>
<summary><b>Additional information for question metadata...</b></summary>
<p></p>

- For numeric answers, we might want to know the numeric type, e.g. does the answer allow decimal places or negative numbers
- For text answers, we might want to know if there was word count restriction
- For codelists, we would want to know what categories that are in the codelist and the codes which represent those categories. We'd also want to know how many options can be selected for the question.

</details>

>[!NOTE]
> BO - do we want to use the terms code list values and code list categories rather than just "codes"? It might be better to be more specific.

## Codelist metadata 

Let's take a closer look into metadata for code lists.

For codelists, we would want to know what codes were used. For example, for Q_11 in the questionnaire screenshot, you could have a code list with the following codes ...

- <1 hours
- 1-2 hours
- 3-4 hours
- 4-5 hours
- 6-7 hours
- 8-9 hours
- 10+ hours

or it could have the codes as stated above ...

- None
- Less than an hour
- 1-3 hours
- 4-6 hours
- 7 hours +

While both code lists capture information on the same concept and through the same data collection method, they would produce data with different levels of specifity. To record information about code lists, we want to capture code and category metadata. We will look at this metadata in more detail in the next unit 2.4. We would also want to caputre whether the code list is single selection or multiple choice.

>[!NOTE]
> KR Is this section needed? Or should we just explore it in the next unit?

## Select type, Codelist reference and variable reference

**Select type**
You may want to give further information about a codelist to say whether respondents can only select a single option (code) or multiple options.

**Code list reference**
As we will unpack in the next unit (2.5 Codes and Categories), if code lists are used, we should create the necessary code list metadata. In the question metadata, we should reference the code list metadata so, if people want to, they can easily access information to further understand the components of the question.

**Variable reference**
Like the code list reference, the variable reference points to our variable metadata. It indicates what variabels are linked to the question so people can jump to that variable in order to see what type of data it collected and how many cases it recorded.


| Question label | Question name |Question text          |  Question instruction      | Response Domain                                     | Select type  | Codelist reference  | Variable reference  |             
|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------
| Q_11          | 11            | How many hours do you spend watching TV, including video and DVDs, on a normal school day? |-  |Code list  | Single select         | hrs_tv1_cl        | hrs_tv_v1
| Q_12          | 12            | Do you have your own personal mobile phone? |-  |Code list  |  Single select         | perphne_cl        | perphne_v1
| Q_13          | 13            |bHow many close friends do you have – friends you could talk to if you were in some kind of trouble? | -  |Numeric  | -        | -        | -        |

## Unit Type, Population and Universe 

Like the variable metadata, we can also include Unit Type, Population and Universe for questions. Thinking back to the last unit, what would the Unit Type, Population and Universe be for these questions?

| Question label | Question name |Unit type             |  Population                | Universe                 |          
|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Q_11          | 11            | Individual            |                            | 
| Q_12          | 12            | Individual            |                            | 
| Q_13          | 13            | Individual            |                           |

## Unit Type, Population and Universe: another example ...

Let's try another example.

Take a look at the study [Understanding Society]

The study captures important information every year about the social and economic circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and health of people living in UK households. It covers approx. 32,000 UK households.

As part of the surveys, participants are asked about their employment. 

If respondents stated they were employed or self-employed, they are asked the following questions...

How were your hours set during January and February?
How were you paid during January and February 2020?
What was your usual take-home pay/earnings during January and February 2020?
During January and February how often did you work at home?[^1]

However if respondents stated they were not in work and have been unemployed for this time period, they did not have to answer these questions.

Considering the above, what do you think the Unit Type, Population and Universe metadata would be for the variable data collected by these questions?

Unit type
- Individuals

Population 
- Individuals over 16 who lived in an household that was part of the Understanding Society's sample of approx. 32,000 households in Great Britain in 2009-10

Universe 
- Individuals in work

>[!NOTE]
> Universe not having a time & geography is slightly confusing, because it is a universe WITHIN a population, so it inherits<br>
> JJ A good example using Undestanding Society could be<br>
> Unit Type == Households<br>
> Population == "probability sample of approx. 24,000 households in Great Britain in 2009-10"<br>
> Universe == "questions asked to those in work".<br>
> This means that you can compare between different populations and time by the characteristics defined by the unvierse e.g. Those in work in USOC with those in work in the Census

>KR referencing DDI unit type, population and universe definitions from DDI
