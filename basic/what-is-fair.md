## Intended Learning Outcome

- Define the FAIR principles
- Explain why the FAIR principles are important
- Illustrate how you can help implement the FAIR principles 

---

## Exercise: Challenges with re-using data

- Think back to your own experiences and/or the Sam1 video
- When trying to find, access and re-use existing data, what made the process difficult or what could have made it easier?

::: notes

## Exercise: Challenges with re-using data (Discussion)

We thought of:

- Cannot find the data from a publication
- Broken links
- Limited information about the data
- Data in unusable or proprietary software
- Multiple places to look 
- Need to request access before can view the data
- Unclear data access process, how long it takes, cost etc.
- Limited context to understand the data

## What is FAIR?

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**e-usable

---

## What is FAIR? (F & A)

**Findable**: Meta(data) should be easy to find for both humans and computers 

- meta(data) platforms for easier discovery
- use of DOIs

**Accessible**: Users need to know how the data can be accessed

- what the access process is

---

## What is FAIR? (I & R)

**Interoperable**: Data can be integrated with other dataÂ and work with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing

- standardised technology and available software
- computers can understand what the data is

**Re-usable**: Meta(data) should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined

- metadata to provide context 
- use of standardised terms
