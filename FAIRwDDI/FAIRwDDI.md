## FAIRwDDI

We propose, in collaboration with CLOSER UK, to organise a one-week sprint in Paris and to build materials in English for complete newcomers to DDI, focusing on data reuse. These materials would also be translated to French by the CDSP team, which has already translated several slide decks of the DDI Training Working Group. This first step would involve traveling costs for two members of the DDI Training WG. Two CDSP data managers that take part in this project will also take part in the sprint. 
The CDSP already created and translated DDI training materials in both English and French and is actively involved in promoting a FAIR data curation with DDI. For example, the CDSP and DORANUM, the French national platform for research data management online training, are currently working on a DDI slide deck that will be published on the DORANUM platform this year. What we aim for in this second work package is a logical follow-up of our previous activity in this domain, which would fully benefit both the Francophone and international community. The  subjects of the training materials will be decided in collaboration with the DDI Training Group, which will take into account the feedback received during the satisfaction surveys fielded to the users of its services (webinars, trainingâ€¦).
