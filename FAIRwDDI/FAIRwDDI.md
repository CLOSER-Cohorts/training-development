## FAIRwDDI

We propose, in collaboration with CLOSER UK, to organise a one-week sprint in Paris and to build materials in English for complete newcomers to DDI, focusing on data reuse. These materials would also be translated to French by the CDSP team, which has already translated several slide decks of the DDI Training Working Group. This first step would involve traveling costs for two members of the DDI Training WG. Two CDSP data managers that take part in this project will also take part in the sprint. 
The CDSP already created and translated DDI training materials in both English and French and is actively involved in promoting a FAIR data curation with DDI. For example, the CDSP and DORANUM, the French national platform for research data management online training, are currently working on a DDI slide deck that will be published on the DORANUM platform this year. What we aim for in this second work package is a logical follow-up of our previous activity in this domain, which would fully benefit both the Francophone and international community. The  subjects of the training materials will be decided in collaboration with the DDI Training Group, which will take into account the feedback received during the satisfaction surveys fielded to the users of its services (webinars, training…). 


## Outline

<summary><b>1. What is the difference between data and metadata?</b></summary>
<p></p>
Data is the primary information collected during a study, an experiment, or an observation. It aims to measure concepts by collecting data that can be represented in different ways, such as numbers, text, symbols, or pictures. <p></p>

For data to be meaningful, it needs to have related information about what it measures and how that should be interpreted - this is what metadata captures. 

_Example: the height of a human, measured to the nearest millimetres, using a stadiometer._

FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data can be made possible through structured metadata. It enables information exchange, and technical infrastructure such as persistent identifiers alongside data format information to be able to compare and combine the data itself.

<summary><b>2. What is the difference between metadata and documentation?</b></summary>
<p></p>

Metadata is a form of documentation that describes data - you may have heard of the phrase “data about data”. It can be used to describe high-level information about a study, such as the year it was conducted or the Principal Investigator (PI), right down to the questions asked to generate the variables.

Metadata differs from other forms of documentation, such as PDFs or STATA codebooks, because it is structured and machine-readable, using formats such as XML. In this way, metadata is more powerful than other forms of documentation as it allows people to quickly discover, understand and (re)use data.

_Example: a search engine cannot read/understand unstructured documentation. As metadata is structured and machine actionable, people can efficiently search and compare vast quantities of information without having to read individual documentation._

<summary><b>3. What are the benefits of creating metadata?</b><p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; :speech_balloon: <i>All the information about my study is in the paper. Why do I need to create metadata?</i></summary>
<p></p>

When data are described in a research paper, it may take time to find and extract the information you need to understand and reuse data, or it may be incomplete. Also, the purpose of a paper is to report the findings of a particular research question, but data can be reused to answer more research questions than the one it was originally intended to measure. When we aim to share and reuse data, another level of description is needed. Metadata provides the information needed for people to efficiently discover, understand and (re)use data, making your data go further. By maximising the potential of data, metadata creates more opportunity for data citations, secondary research and cross-study comparison. It is also helpful for your future self, to help you understand your own data in the future.

<summary><b>4. What is a metadata standard anyway?</b><p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; :speech_balloon: <i>I already have a STATA codebook. Why do I need anything else?</i></summary>
<p></p>

Metadata standards are a ready-made framework for describing the data and related information. They provide a consistent way to structure your metadata, enabling sharing and comparing across studies. While there are a few cross-discipline standards, they are often discipline specific, focusing on a particular research area.

Even within a research area, there may be different ways of saying the same thing. A standard gives a common language so there is a shared understanding.

_Example: The term **“Creator”** is used to describe the person, corporate body, or agency responsible for making the resource in several metadata standards. The **“Publisher”** is the person or organization responsible for making the resource available in its present form._

Metadata may be associated with other metadata to provide a more detailed level of information.  

_Example: **“Publisher”** can be associated with other information, such as name, role and organisation._

Metadata standards often allow the addition of other content you may want to use in your organisation but not share with others.

<summary><b>5. I have my own system of documentation. Why do I need to use a metadata standard?</b></summary>
<p></p>

Even if you have your own system of documentation, using a metadata standard makes your metadata more powerful. Metadata standards can increase the visibility and usability of your data, for instance within a data archive or repository. 

They make your metadata interoperable, meaning it can be exchanged with other systems and tools and compared to other people’s metadata. The more people who adopt a standard, the more powerful and effective it becomes. 

Metadata standards transform metadata from a personal filing system into a tool that can help you search, compare and preserve metadata across studies. They also save you time, as metadata standards give you a ready-made framework, telling you what to document, the metadata fields, and their allowable inputs.

<summary><b>6. What is DDI?</b></summary>
<p></p>

“The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) is a suite of products that describes metadata about both quantitative and qualitative research data in the social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences. The DDI suite is a set of free standards that help you document and manage different stages of the research data lifecycle, including conceptualization, collection, process, distribution, discovery, and archiving.”

For example, DDI offers a set of controlled vocabularies commonly used in social science and other disciplines to support systems designed to identify, locate, and access data for research purposes. 
It can also be easily mapped with other standards, such as Dublin Core, to facilitate data interoperability between different repositories or systems.

<summary><b>7. Why should I use DDI?</b> <p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; :speech_balloon: <i>I've got my own metadata standard. Why should I change to DDI?</i> <p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; :speech_balloon: <i>I have to help researchers share their data. Why should I use the DDI standard?</i></summary>
<p></p>

Using standards makes data usable to more than just the project or person that created the data. It also makes interoperability possible.

Documenting data with open standards like DDI improves consistency, integration, and quality, producing FAIR data, realizing its full potential for people, software, and machines (DDI website). 

The DDI products will allow you to document all the stages of the research process, from conceptualisation, collection, discovery and archiving. They allow you to document the data itself (example: questions, code lists, etc.). 

This will improve its trustworthiness, discoverability and reusability. You/your institution will contribute to the open science movement and join the many researchers, data scientists, data managers, archives, repositories that use DDI.

<summary><b>8. Who uses DDI?</b> <p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; :speech_balloon: <i>I'm a researcher. Is it my job to create metadata?</i> <p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; :speech_balloon: <i>Isn't DDI just for social science surveys/data?</i> </summary>
<p></p>

DDI is used in over 500 organisations, including archives, social and health related research organisations and national statistics agencies.  

Certain platforms or repositories will suggest researchers to use specific standards when it comes to creating metadata. For example, in France, DDI is recommended in the Passport for Open Science of the Ministry of Higher Education and Research as a standard for metadata when describing data from surveys and other observation methods in social science, behavioural science, economics and healthcare. 

Who better than you to explain the production process of your own data? 

Even though it may seem a bit technical or intimidating, metadata experts can help you to get started. Feel free to get in touch with the DDI Alliance https://ddialliance.org/request-training

<summary><b>9. What are the differences between the DDI products?</b><p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; :speech_balloon: <i>I want to use the best metadata standard. Which one should I use?</i></summary>
<p></p>

There is no ‘best’ metadata standard, as different standards are designed to address different purposes and needs. Rather than looking for the ‘best’ standard, it’s about finding the right standard for your metadata.

When finding the right standard, you need to consider: what’s the common standard used in your discipline, what metadata do you want to capture (e.g. study level information, data level information etc.), how much time and resource do you have to create and manage metadata.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>10. What types of metadata can you create with DDI?</b><p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; :speech_balloon: <i>I collect data using surveys. What DDI metadata should I document?</i><p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; :speech_balloon: <i>I don't have quant data. Can I still use DDI?</i></summary>
<p></p>

The DDI standard allows you to document a variety of metadata, from high-level information about your study, to very detailed  information about questions and variables. It is up to you to decide which elements of the standard you adopt. This decision depends on the scope of your research project and the resources available to you, but some metadata is always better than none. A good starting point is to consider what information someone else would need to understand and use your data, or for you to understand and use your own data in the future.

<details>
<summary><b>11. What resources do I need to create DDI metadata (e.g. time, money, tools?)</b><p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; :speech_balloon: <i>I don't have time to do extra work. How much time and money will it take me to create metadata?</i><p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp; :speech_balloon: <i>I want to create DDI metadata. How do I do it?</i></summary>
<p></p>

DDI is a free, openly available standard which anyone can access and use. It provides a framework and guidance on how to create open metadata. There are different tools and software you can use to create and manage this metadata, some free and some commercial. DDI provides a list of tools you could use here, which range in functionality and scope.

What tools you use, how long it will take and how much it will cost, depends on the research and what metadata you want to create. If you have a small one-off project, you may only want to capture study level information. However, if you’re working on large datasets that you are planning to repeat and share widely, you may want to capture more detailed information such as variable information.

It’s important to think about metadata from the beginning of a research project. Creating and managing metadata from the start will save time and money, so you’re not stuck retrospectively creating metadata.

<summary><b>12. It is not mandatory to create metadata. Why do I need to do it? What are the benefits?</b></summary>
<p></p>

While some funders and organisations require metadata, their creation is often optional. Some researchers are worried that it is a drain on time and resources. So, why do it?

Creating robust metadata actually saves you time in the long run and maximises the use of your data. Without metadata, your data ends up in a silo as it is harder to discover,understand and (re)use. Researchers waste time independently seeking or giving clarification around datasets.

Metadata allows people to compare and exchange information between different datasets. Data is easier to discover and understand, leading to more data citations, secondary research and cross-study comparison. It’s also a useful note to self, helping you organise your data and refer to it in the future.

<summary><b>I've created metadata for my research project. Now what?</b></summary>
<p></p>

Metadata should be created from the beginning of the research project. Using an open standard like DDI for their creation will help: 

- If you want a way to make documenting and sharing your data easier
- If you are interested in using a common documentation standard that permits Web display
- If you want to export and repurpose  your documentation to other formats and products, for example create PDF files
- DDI is a way to standardize documentation and make it interoperable. DDI uses XML to create FAIR metadata that is structured yet flexible, and not platform dependent.
